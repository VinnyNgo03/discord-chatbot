Rigby,Yes! Fist Pump!
Rigby,"(laughs) Yeah, yeah!"
Rigby,(laughs)
Main Announcer,"Listen up, pump heads, Fist Pump is coming to Slammers! They just got out of jail and rehab, and now they're back, and ready to rock your 11-to-15-year-old pants off! That's our demographic, get over it. That's right! Fist Pump live!"
Background Announcer,Live!
Main Announcer,At Slammers this Friday!
Background Announcer,Friday!
Main Announcer,Be there or be a loser!
Mordecai,(laughs) There's gonna be so many losers at that concert.
Rigby,We have to go to that concert!
Mordecai,"Seriously? Dude, they were cool in the third grade, but now...?"
Rigby,"Correction, they're cool in any grade, but you wouldn't know that. Probably because you hate yourself or something!"
Mordecai,"Dude, we don't have the money for those tickets."
Rigby,"Doesn't even matter! We can figure out a way, but you're too busy figuring out a way to hate yourself!"
Mordecai,Why do you wanna go so bad?
Rigby,Going to this concert could be the biggest moment of my life...
Mordecai,"Wow, sounds like your life sucks."
Rigby,Shut up!
Margaret,"Hey, guys."
Mordecai,"Hey, Margaret."
Margaret,Were you guys talking about the concert?
Rigby,We were talking about a concert. Is the concert you're talking about Fist Pump?
Margaret,"(laughs) Yeah, cool."
Mordecai,"Wait, you're going?"
Margaret,"Yeah, I am! I know they're kinda old, but I remember them from when I was a kid. Besides, everyone is gonna be there. It's gonna be fun. You guys gonna go?"
Mordecai,I'm totally gonna go.
Rigby,"Oh, so now you're gonn-"
Mordecai,We'll be there.
Margaret,"Cool, see you guys there."
Mordecai,"Yeah, see ya."
Rigby,I can't believe you're going to a Fist Pump concert just for some lady pecs.
Mordecai,"Rigby, one day you'll be old enough to understand the real reason that people go to concerts."
Rigby,"Whatever, it's to listen to music, I already know that. Now, how are we going to get the money for those tickets?"
Mordecai,"Dude, it's gonna be easy. We just have to work some extra hours."
Rigby,Extra work? I don't even like regular work.
Mordecai,Do you like Fist Pump?
Rigby,Yes.
Mordecai,"Hmph, then you like extra work."
Rigby,"Hmph, fine."
Mordecai,"Hmph, hmph."
Rigby,"Hmph, hmph."
Rigby,"Hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph..."
Benson,"Let me get this straight. You and Rigby want me to give you overtime, and even though you can't even finish the regular amount of work that you normally have, you want me to add on even more..."
Mordecai,Yes.
Benson,(laughs) No.
Rigby,"Aw, come on, Benson, please! Fist Pump is playing at Slammers and we don't have enough money for tickets!"
Benson,(laughs) Are you serious? Fist Pump? You know what kind of people go to those concerts?
Muscle Man,"Woo! That's right, ladies! We got two tickets to Fist Pump! See you later, grandmas!"
Rigby,"Benson, you listen and you listen good."
Rigby,Please Benson! Please give us overtime! Please!
Benson,What is the big deal? It's just some talentless band.
Skips,"Actually, they aren't that bad, not that I'm into that stuff. We are pretty backed up though. I think you should give them the work."
Pops,"Oh, I agree. I say if they want to see ""Pump Fist"", then let them see ""Pump Fist""!"
Benson,(sighs) Fine. You can work overtime.
Rigby,OOHHHH!!!
Benson,"Here's a list of things we need done, when you finish them, you'll get your money."
Rigby,OOOHHHH!!!
Benson,(sighs) Idiots.
Montage,"Mordecai and Rigby clean the gutters, with Rigby on the roof grabbing the dirt and throwing it down to Mordecai on the ground, holding a bucket. They then clean the cart, with Rigby wiping the front of the cart and Mordecai wiping the back, while holding a hose. They then take out the trash, with Mordecai throwing a trash bag to Rigby, who dumps it into a dumpster. They both start fist-pumping and Mordecai crosses ""Trash"" off the chore list. They then clean the bathroom, with Rigby unclogging the toilet and Mordecai wiping down the sink. They then wash the dishes, with Mordecai pulling dishes out of the sink and passing them to Rigby to dry them off. They start fist-pumping again, and Mordecai crosses ""Dishes"" off the chore list. The montage is then interrupted as Rigby switches off a boombox. He and Mordecai look exhausted)"
Rigby,"Dude, I'm fading fast."
Mordecai,"Don't worry, dude. We just gotta fight it with coffee!"
Mordecai,Two for Fist Pump.
Ticket Guy,$400.
Rigby,What?
Mordecai,But I thought they were 50!?
Ticket Guy,$50 tickets are sold out. All that's left are Super Deluxe front row seats.
Mordecai,"Aw, man!"
Rigby,"No, no, no!"
Rigby,"Mordecai, wait! Wait, man. We can't give up. Fist Pump!"
Mordecai,"I know, dude, but I just don't want to work anymo-oh my..."
Mordecai,"Maybe I could work a little more. Alright, dude. Let's do this."
Mordecai,You're lucky I care about lady pecs.
Mordecai,"Benson, we need more money."
Rigby,"Yeah, give us more money."
Benson,There's no more chores left. Unless...you want to mow the lawn?
Rigby,The lawn!?
Mordecai,"Aw, what? That'll take forever!"
Benson,Here's the keys. You know where the mower is.
Benson,Good luck.
Mordecai,"Hmph, hmph. Who needs luck when we have coffee?"
Rigby,Ohhhhhh...
Rigby,"Dude, seriously though, my eyes won't stay open anymore, and I think we're almost out of coffee."
Mordecai,"Nonsense, dude. We got plenty of coffee."
Rigby,"Mordecai, what happened?"
Mordecai,Need more coffee...need more Margaret...
Rigby,Fist Pump...
Coffee Bean,"Coffee, coffee."
Coffee Bean,Coffee?
Translator,"""Greetings, fellow Fist Pump fans. May we help you get some tickets?"""
Mordecai,What? Who are you?
Giant Coffee Bean,"Coffee, coffee!"
Translator,"""As you can see, I am a giant coffee bean. I can bring you caffeine. Do you accept?"""
Mordecai,"Wait, what?"
Giant Coffee Bean,"Coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee, coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee."
Rigby,"Ah, cool, a contract! Let's sign it!"
Giant Coffee Bean,"Coffee, coffee!"
Montage,"""Working for the Weekend"" by Loverboy starts playing. A text card pops up saying ""MAGIC!"" Mordecai and Rigby appear in the middle of the Park pumping their fists. The lawnmower then appears below them. They drive off. The Coffee Bean and Translator are walking along, with close-ups of their legs and butts. The Coffee Bean then shoots coffee out of his hands, which goes straight into Mordecai and Rigby's mouths. They turn and look at the audience while pumping their fists. They drive off in the lawnmower and create the words ""Fist Pump"" in the grass. The Coffee Bean and Translator click their fingers and two empty coffee jugs held by Mordecai and Rigby are magically filled up with coffee. They take a sip from the jugs and backflip into the lawnmower, where they pump their fists again. The Coffee Bean and Translator briefly join Mordecai and Rigby on the lawnmower, as they all pump their fists. The four of them are then seen dancing in the middle of the park. Suddenly, in the Void, multiple images of the Coffee Bean pop up, as they transition into regular coffee beans and fall into a Coffee Pro coffee machine. A coffee jug is seen being filled up, and is taken by the Translator, who passes it to Mordecai as he and Rigby drive by. Mordecai takes a sip then passes it to Rigby, who just pours the jug over himself, before throwing it away. The Coffee Bean winks, as Mordecai and Rigby drive in circles in a novelty-sized cup, and burst through it. Benson stands in the middle of the lawn, nodding impressed, and pulls out his wallet. Mordecai and Rigby quickly drive by and Mordecai, holding a vacuum, sucks away Benson's wallet. Benson turns to see Mordecai and Rigby riding into the sunset, which then transforms into the Coffee Bean, who smiles and leaks coffee out of his mouth. Later, Mordecai and Rigby are walking into their room holding two diamond-coated tickets)"
Mordecai and Rigby,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Mordecai,"Aw, man, I didn't know deluxe tickets were coated in diamonds."
Rigby,So cool...
Translator,Where are the other two tickets?
Rigby,"Oh, jeez!"
Rigby,"There's no 'other tickets', man. We only had enough for two."
Translator,But we had a contract!
Rigby,Woo!!! Fist Pump!!!!
Mordecai,"Woo, Fist Pump."
Giant Coffee Bean,"Coffee, coffee, coffee!"
Rigby,"Dude, check it. Bang bang! Dude, I've got two if you want to take one to the concert."
Translator,"Mordecai and Rigby, we are very excited for you to be the ones to see Fist Pump. Please accept this coffee to help you make it through concert."
Rigby,Thanks!
Mordecai,"Hey, what the...? This isn't...coffee!?"
Translator,It's chamomile tea...the sleepiest of all teas...
Mordecai,"Rigby, get the...(yawns)"
Mordecai,....tickets.
Mordecai,Huh?
Mordecai,Hey!
Mordecai,"Rigby, come on, they got the tickets! Come on, let's go, let's go!"
Rigby,Fist Pump!
Rigby,Now what are we supposed to do?
Mordecai,Come on. I have an idea.
Benson,You morons! Get back here and help me pick up my gumballs!
Giant Coffee Bean,Coffee...
Mordecai,Give us the tickets!
Translator,"Uh, Mordecai and Rigby. Uh, funny seeing you here..."
Mordecai,"A chainsaw, are you serious!? I mean, what's up with the chainsaw?"
Giant Coffee Bean,Coffee! Coffee coffee!
Translator,Why didn't you buy us tickets?
Mordecai,What are you talking about? We never said we'd buy you tickets!
Translator,But we had a contract!
Rigby,Shut it!
Mordecai,"You know, at first I thought you were cool. But now, I know that you're both total losers."
Rigby,Everybody hates you.
Mordecai,"Oh, and I just realized something."
Translator,What?
Mordecai,Your coffee sucks.
Mordecai and Rigby,OOOHHHH!!!
Llama Guy,"'Sup, Mordecai!?"
Mordecai,"Hey, dude."
Rigby,"Dude, there they are!"
Rigby,We did it! Fist Pump! Fist Pump!
Mordecai,I wonder where Margaret's sitting?
Mordecai,"Aw, sick! It's all sweaty!"
Muscle Man,Woo!! I just threw my shirt! Bring out Fist Pump! Let's do it!
Margaret,"Hey, Mordecai!"
Mordecai,"Hey, Margaret! Fist Pump!"
Margaret,"Mordecai! You have to meet my boyfriend, Slasher!"
Margaret,"Hey, Slasher! That's my friend, Mordecai!"
Slasher,"You should tell your friend he should stop pumping it in the wind, and start pumping in at the gym."
Margaret,Don't be such a jerk!
Slasher,You're dead.
Mordecai,"Oh, this sucks."
Rigby,"Aw, don't worry about her, you'll get another chance."
Rigby,(laughs) Woo!!
Rigby,"Dude, wake up! They're about to come out!"
Rigby,Wait. Must...stay awake. Must...see best band of all... time!
Rigby,"Aw, crap."
Fist Pump,"'Ello! We are Fist Pump! One, two, three, four!"
Mordecai,"Augh, this sucks."
Rigby,What's that supposed to mean?
Mordecai,"It means that the next time we get to pick our job for the day, I get to pick. Why did you pick the Snack Bar?! This is like the worst job at the park, dude!"
Rigby,I think it's the funniest job at the park.
Mordecai,You don't really think that. You just don't want to admit that you're wrong.
Rigby,Why would I admit something that I'm not?
Mordecai,"Dude, seriously, this is more boring than watching you trying to read a children's book."
Rigby,Is it more boring than your face?
Mordecai,I don't know. Is it more boring than my fist in your face?
Rigby,"Is it more boring than my fist in your face, You turd!"
Mordecai,You're a turd!
Rigby,"No, you're a turd!"
Rigby,(Starts fighting) You're the turd!
Pops,"Mordecai, Rigby, stop! We can all be turds."
Rigby,"(Start dusting themselves off) Oh, hey, Pops."
Pops,"So, how do you like being the guardians of the snacks?"
Rigby,It's awesome.
Mordecai,This place is lame.
Pops,"But, Mordecai, don't you like eating snacks for free?"
Mordecai,What?
Pops,"When I work here, all the snacks are free! Ta ta. (Walks away)"
Rigby,I guess this means I was right about the Snack Bar.
Mordecai,Yeaa-uhh!
Mordecai,"I need to eat something healthy, like a salad or something."
Rigby,"What? Are you kidding? Dude, all these snacks are free, dude. (Stops himself from vomiting) Trust me. If we keep eating, we'll feel better in no time."
Mordecai,"Oh, if we eat more, we'll feel better? Dude, quit being a loser."
Rigby,"Loser?! I don't know that I want to listen to the guy who was wrong about the Snack Bar being cool. No, I think I'd rather listen to the guy who's right all the time. ME. (Holds up a fried soda cup and takes a bite out of it)"
Mordecai,Augh! Sick!
Rigby,Hmm. Hmm. (Grimaces in pain as his stomach rumbles)
Mordecai,(Takes a bite of the salad) Ahh. I feel so much better.
Rigby,"(Who is next to a blender with a doughnut, candy, and other junk food inside) So do I. (He starts the blender, grinding all the junk food into goop. He then proceeds to drink it, grimacing in pain again as his stomach rumbles.)"
Mordecai,"Dude, I'm telling you. If you keep eating like that, your body's gonna quit on you."
Rigby,Stop talking!
Mordecai,Whatever. I'm just trying to help. (Walks out of the kitchen)
Rigby,"Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. I showed him. (Puts another doughnut in his mouth. A split second later, Rigby is rolling on the floor, groaning in pain) Why isn't more food working...? (Screams in pain, then picks up the doughnut next to him) One more should do it... (He suddenly drops the doughnut as he loses control of his hands) Huh? (Rigby's hands grab his face, pull him to his feet, and drag him around the room. He smashes into a wall, then falls over the fallen chair. His hands then pull really hard, causing his eyes to roll back into his head and glow) What are you doing?! (His hands keep pulling, eventually ejecting Rigby as a green glob of consciousness with Rigby's eyes.)"
Rigby,"Aww, let me back in! (His body pushes him away and runs off) Wait! Come back! (Tries to follow his body, but ends up inside a bucket on the floor) Ohhh... Whatever. I'm just gonna chill in this bucket."
Rigby,(Calling from the bucket) Mordecai! Mordecai!
Mordecai,"(Sees Rigby as the green glob) Aww, SICK! What the heck is that?!"
Rigby,"Ha ha! Who's the loser now, Mordecai?"
Mordecai,Wait... Rigby?
Rigby,"Dude, in your face! I was right! My stomach doesn't even hurt anymore."
Mordecai,"That's because you don't even have a BODY anymore! Dude, this is bad."
Rigby,"Yeah, bad like good! Now shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole!"
Mordecai,"(Sighs, picks up the bucket) You better hope Skips knows how to fix this."
Skips,What happened to his body?
Mordecai,"Dude, I don't know. It like, ditched him or something from eating too much junk food."
Skips,"Well, it looks like it's not that big of a deal, if he doesn't mind being a bodiless consciousness for the rest of his life."
Rigby,"It's cool, I don't mind."
Mordecai,"What?! No! Dude, quit being a loser."
Rigby,Since when does being right make you a--
Mordecai,"(Puts a lid on the bucket and sighs) Skips, what do we have to do? I can't let him stay like this."
Skips,"That's a bit tougher. Once the body departs, you only have till sunset to get it back. You know where it is?"
Mordecai,No.
Skips,"Hmm, then we have to find it. Let's go."
Mordecai,"(Walking out the door with Skips) We'll be right back, Rigby. Just stay here."
Rigby,What? Where ya goin'? At least shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole. Guys? Guys?
Rigby,"(Moving the bucket with all his might, although bodiless; grunting) Ergghh!! Phew! I guess it is kinda harder to move around without my body. (Rigby then sees the hockey stick and roller skates, then comes up with an idea to move around easier)"
Skips,Shh. (Parts the bushes)
Mordecai,(Whispering) What's it doing?
Skips,Eating a salad. Rush him on the count of three.
Mordecai,Okay.
Skips,One....two....
Rigby,"(Loudly) Hey, guys! What's up?"
Mordecai and Skips,No!
Skips,(Points at Rigby) We told you to stay put! (Walks away)
Mordecai,"Ugh! Rigby, you scared it away!"
Rigby,"Oh, don't worry about that! Remember how I said I don't need it? Well, I was right again! Dude, check it! (Wheels around as Mordecai watches in horror) It's a trash can and a roller blade."
Mordecai,"I can't believe you! Please, just stay put! (Walks away)"
Rigby,Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. All this being right is making me hungry.
Muscle Man,"This, Sucks! Wait, what is that? (Sees Rigby in the bucket, skating to the Snack Bar)"
Rigby,(Slams the Snack Bar door open) Gimme some snacks!
Hi Five Ghost,(Scared) What are you?
Muscle Man,Looks like a bucket of diarrhea.
Rigby,"It's me, Rigby!"
Muscle Man,"(Terrified) Oh, man! That boot with wheels stole Rigby's voice!"
Rigby,"No, I didn't steal anything."
Muscle Man,"You're not stealing these voices. C'mon Fives, let's bail! (They climb out of the Snack Bar and run off)"
Rigby,Come back!
Muscle Man,"No way, bro!"
Rigby,"It's me, Rigby! (Trips on a rock) Aw, man."
Skips,(Sniffs the salad) He's close. I'll take care of the body. You go find Rigby. We don't have much time.
Mordecai,Rigby! Rigby! Where is he?
Mordecai,"Hey, have you guys seen Rigby?"
Muscle Man,No. Have you seen a magic garbage can? We need to beat the living-
Mordecai,Magic garbage can? That was Rigby! Which way did he go?
Mordecai,(Gasps) Rigby!
Rigby,Help!
Bodybuilder,No-one can hear you.
Rigby,Who's there?
Bodybuilder,"Don't worry: just another bodiless consciousness. (Admires Rigby and rolls around him, talking) Woah! Hey, did you work out way too hard, too?"
Rigby,N-no. I ate too much junk food.
Bodybuilder,"Yep, that'll do it. Me? I was a bodybuilder. (We see a flashback of a huge, muscular man lifting weights at a gym) I could have gone pro. My friend kept telling me, (a pink blob morphs out of the basketball and starts speaking in angry, mocking tones) ""If you keep pumpin' iron like that, your body's gonna quit on you!"" I told him he was full of it! (Morphs back into the basketball) But I didn't get my bod' back in time and now look at me: stuck with a basketball for a body."
Rigby,"Yeah, well, my body's still good."
Bodybuilder,"Wait, your body's still good? Well, whatcha doin' in here, dummy?"
Rigby,I...
Bodybuilder,You must not want it. Mind if I take it?
Rigby,No!
Bodybuilder,"Don't worry, I'll find it. So long, sucka!"
Rigby,"(Anguished) No!!! (Falls over, crying, but looks over to see the trash door open and Mordecai appear) Mordecai! You were right and I was wrong! (Still crying) I'm sorry for being such a loser. (Pitifully whining in a high voice) Please help me get my body back...!"
Mordecai,"Don't worry, dude. I think we can get it back in time. And even if we mess up, you've always got this! (Holds up the skate-can)"
Mordecai and Rigby,Ohhhhh!!!
Rigby,"But seriously, dude, I want my old body back."
Mordecai,"(Into two-way radio) Skips, I found Rigby."
Skips,"(Through radio) I found the body, but you'd better hurry. We got a problem."
Bodybuilder,"Body, you're worthless! (Slaps the body) I can't believe you can't do a simple clean and jerk!"
Rigby,Hey! What are you doin' with my body?!
Bodybuilder,"Oh, it's you! (Morphs back into Rigby's body) What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?"
Rigby,"No, not pretty cool. You dress me like a loser!"
Bodybuilder,"(Flexes grossly) Aw, you don't like weightlifting singlets? No wonder your body left you. Oh well. Now it's not you anymore... (Flexes again) It's me."
Rigby,Augh! Gimme back my body!
Bodybuilder,Finders keepers.
Mordecai,Skips!
Skips,We tried it the nice way. Now we do it the Skips way.
Bodybuilder,"So long, suckers!"
Skips,He's too fast.
Pops,"Are you having a game of tag, turds?"
Skips,I really wish you wouldn't teach him those words.
Skips,"Pops, slide over."
Rigby,I'll take it from here!
Mordecai,Rigby! No!
Skips,It's too steep. We'll have to go around.
Rigby,Give me my body back!
Bodybuilder,No! Get off me!
Rigby,Get outta my body!
Bodybuilder,"No: you get outta the body, you worm!"
Bodybuilder,"Aw, man, my mouth was open!"
Rigby,"Dude, we did it! I got my body back!"
Mordecai,(Moans in disgust) Are you sure you still want it?
Rigby,I'll never treat you like that again.
Skips,Quick! Before the sun sets.
Pops,(Eyes wide in wonder) Glorious.
Mordecai,Dude. How do you feel?
Rigby,(Screaming)
Rigby,"Well Mordecai, I guess you were right about the Snack Bar being lame. Especially now that we're not into eating all the free snacks."
Mordecai,"Oh, about that. Those snacks weren't free."
Rigby,What?
Mordecai,Turns out only Pops gets snacks for free.
Rigby,(Pitiful whine) Pops?
Mordecai,Yeah. And I guess we're supposed to work here for the next six months just to pay for it all.
Rigby,Ohhh... turds.
Rigby,"Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take back what you said about my mom!"
Rigby,I'll kill you!
Mordecai,Tag up! Tag up!
Rigby,What?
Rigby,"Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?"
Rigby,I think he wants me to put the hurt on him.
Mordecai,I think he wants you to put the hurt on him.
Rigby,You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?
Mordecai,"Yes, I do!"
Rigby,Yeah-yuh! Did you see how awesome it was when I hit the trampoline?
Mordecai,"(laughs) Yeah, I did! But it wasn't as awesome as when you punched that hole in the wall."
Mordecai,"I can't believe I listened to you! I knew I should've gone out to do some work, but no, ""Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!"""
Rigby,But it was fun.
Mordecai,"Well, yeah, but now there's a big hole in the wall! Dude, we're 23 years old, we shouldn't be busting holes in walls. We're gonna get fired for this!"
Rigby,You mean you're gonna get fired for this.
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,"You're the one who threw me too hard, you hole!"
Mordecai,"Don't call me a hole! You're the hole, you're the one who wanted to wrestle!"
Rigby,"Okay, okay...let's not blame anyone. Now, how in the H are we gonna fix this S?"
Mordecai,"I don't know man. (scoffs) We can't fix it, and we definitely can't pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money! Unless you have some money."
Rigby,"No. Besides, I don't even know how much it'd cost to fix a hole like this. Probably a ton."
Mordecai,Exactly. Which leaves us with only one possible solution: We convince Benson to give us raises so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.
Rigby,"Dude... you are a genius! Of course, raises!"
Mordecai,"Okay, dude, here'sâ€”"
Rigby,"Let me stop you there, because I already know what you're going to say...hamboning."
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,"Yeah, dude, hamboning! We just go up to Benson and we'll be all like, ""We both want raises!"""
Mordecai,"No, man! Stop it!"
Mordecai,We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all theâ€”
Rigby,"No, no, no, that's not gonna work! What are you, 65?"
Rigby,"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"
Rigby,"Come on! I'm telling you, dude. Hamboning..."
Mordecai,No...
Rigby,"Hamboning will save your life some day. It'll be all like, ""What? You trying to mug me?"""
Mordecai,"No! We're not doing that, okay? Okay?"
Rigby,Fine... (gasps) I know what to do!
Rigby,(snickers) Are you ready for raises?
Rigby,Boop-bweep-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boooo!
Mordecai,"Whoa-ho-ho-ho, how did you get that?"
Rigby,I have my methods.
Rigby,(snickers)
Mordecai,"I don't know, dude. How's that gonna get us raises?"
Rigby,"Aw, come on, man! Look!"
Rigby,Just come check it out.
Mordecai,Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Mordecai,This is the answer to all our problems. Have you named her yet?
Rigby,"Actually, I thought you could do the honors."
Mordecai,Really?
Rigby,Mm-hmm.
Mordecai,"You know, I've always wanted to date a girl named ""The Power""."
Rigby,The Power?
Mordecai,Mm-hmm.
Rigby,I like it.
Rigby,Cool...
Mordecai,"Alright, this time with feeling."
Rigby,"Yeah, yeah! Ready?"
Mordecai,"Yeah, yeah."
Rigby,Okay.
Rigby,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
Rigby,"Give us a raise, loser!"
Rigby,"Hey, it's Pops."
Pops,(laughs) Hello!
Mordecai,"Hey Pops, what's up?"
Pops,Is that the sound of music I hear? (laughs)
Rigby,"Dude, let's use The Power on Pops."
Mordecai,"I don't know, Pops is kinda weird."
Rigby,"Exactly, at least we can test it out on him, and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work."
Mordecai,"Okay, but let's not call him a loser."
Rigby,Why not?
Mordecai,"He's sensitive. I don't want him to cry, I just want him to give us a raise."
Rigby,"Okay, let's do it."
Rigby,Hey Pops! Check it.
Rigby,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
Rigby,"Give us a raise, Pops!"
Pops,"(laughs) Good show, jolly good show! A pay increase, yes, yes of course. Just let me get my billfold."
Pops,Butterscotch Ripple?
Pops,Ta-ta!
Mordecai,"Dude, I think that just worked."
Rigby,"Yeah, I know."
Mordecai,"I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird, he might have given us actual money."
Rigby,Totally.
Benson,Ugh...
Rigby,"Hey, Benson!"
Rigby,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
Benson,What are you doing?
Rigby,"Give us a raise, loser!"
Benson,"You know, you guys have been working harder. I think you deserve a raise. We can negotiate your new rates later in the week, but for now, how's twenty bucks sound?"
Benson,Keep up the good work.
Rigby,Do you realize what this means?
Mordecai,We can fix the hole?
Rigby,"No, we can do everything we ever wanted!"
Transition into the next scenario,"Mordecai and Rigby, back as their regular unclothed selves, are driving a muscle car. They look towards each other and use The Power to turn it into a hot rod, with flames painted on the side and lower suspension. They drive off and enter the void again, mashing the keys on The Power and summoning multiple things: a bowling pin, fuzzy dice, a guitar, a magic 8-ball, drum-sticks, a cap, a bowling ball, sunglasses, drum pieces, colorful shoes, a samurai sword and a CD titled ""80's METAL!!"". The montage ends with Mordecai and Rigby flying and landing in the Park, they laugh whilst looking up at each other then bump into Skips)"
Skips,You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did.
Rigby,What? The flying or the hole?
Skips,What hole?
Rigby,"Dude, get to The Power, he knows."
Skips,Knows what?
Mordecai,"Nothing Skips, uh, we were just getting back to work."
Mordecai,"Dude, kick it to max power."
Rigby,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
Rigby,Using The Power in your face!
Rigby,Sending you back to your place!
Rigby,Don't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches!
Rigby,"Boop-boop bweep, boo-boo-boo, boo-bweep-bee-boo, bee-bee-beep, bee-bee-beep, synchronized!"
Rigby,"Go away, Skips, it's time for you to go away!"
Mordecai,It's time for you to go to your room!
Rigby,"Yeah, Skips, it's time for you to go to the moon"
Mordecai,(gasps) Where'd he go?
Rigby,Uh...
Mordecai,Did you just send Skips to the moon?
Rigby,Isn't that what you said?
Mordecai,"No, room! I sent him to his room, not the moon, you idiot! Dude, wish him back."
Rigby,But it doesn't work that way.
Mordecai,What do you mean?
Rigby,"I can't see him, can I?"
Mordecai,"Ugh, then we have to go get him."
Rigby,But he's going to be pissed!
Mordecai,Better than him being dead!
Benson,"Hey! Hey, have you two seen Skips?"
Mordecai,Rigby sent him to the Moon.
Benson,"Wait, what?"
Mordecai,We accidentally sent Skips to the Moon with this keyboard and now we have to get him back.
Pops,"Ooh, I love the Moon."
Benson,"Come on, where's Skips?"
Mordecai,"Ugh! Look, we'll show you."
Rigby,"Come on, let's go! Sheesh, you take forever."
Mordecai,"Sorry, Pops had to go to the bathroom."
Pops,Twice.
Benson,"So, what do we do?"
Mordecai,"Don't worry, we got it."
Rigby,Take us to the Moon! Take us to the Moon! Whoa! Won't you take us to the Moon?
Benson,Haha...very funâ€”
Benson,What is all this junk?
Rigby,"Um, don't get mad at me guys, but, uh - I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon while you guys were in the house."
Rigby,"A bunch of baby ducks, send 'em to the moon. Soda machine that doesn't work, send 'em to the moon!"
Mordecai,You drill bit! What else did you send?
Pops,"Look, it's Skips! There he is!"
Mordecai,"Oh great, it had to be a monster."
Benson,What is that?
Mordecai,"Rigby, you guys go get Skips! We'll pick you up!"
Rigby,"Okay, okay!"
Mordecai,"Pops, help me with this!"
Rigby,"Let's go, let's go!"
Benson,Come on!
Rigby,"Gimme a break, I have to come up with the words, you know!"
Rigby,"Okay, I got it."
Rigby,"G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
Benson,What?
Rigby,"Dude, I think the batteries just died."
Benson,What!?
Mordecai,Hurry up dude!
Rigby,The batteries are dead!
Mordecai,What!?
Rigby,"Hamboning will save your life some day. It'll be all like, ""What? You trying to mug me?"" I'm telling you, dude! Hamboning!"
Rigby,I know what to do.
Rigby,Hold this.
Rigby,No!!
Rigby,Woo! Hamboning!
Mordecai,I can't believe you just did that.
Skips,Use your keyboard!
Rigby,The batteries are dead!
Skips,Play it!
Skips,"Take us home, take us home, take us all back home!"
Rigby,(laughs) We did it! Yeah!
Rigby,"Hey, that's mine!"
Benson,"Nope, you sent him to the moon so the least you can do is give him your keyboard! Right, Skips?"
Skips,Right.
Rigby,Aww...
Benson,And let's have it...
Rigby,What?
Benson,The forty dollars you two conned out of me with that stupid keyboard crap! I know you've still got it. Now give it back.
Benson,Now clean up this mess or you're fired!
Benson,"Ugh, can you believe this?"
Skips,No.
Rigby,"Aw, dude, this sucks. The hole's still there. Do you think Benson noticed it?"
Mordecai,He won't now!
Rigby,"Dude, you're a genius!"
Margaret,"Here're you guys, enjoy."
Rigby,"(Takes a big sip from his coffee) Ah! Nothing beats drinkin' joe with my bro! Haha, right, Mordecai?"
Mordecai,"Huh, what? Yeeeeeaaahh. (Sighs) (Margaret then looks at Mordecai) Dude, Margaret totally just smiled at me."
Rigby,No she didn't.
Mordecai,Yes she did.
Rigby,Then why don't you ask her out?
Mordecai,Agh. It's not that easy. You wouldn't understand.
Rigby,"Yeah, I wouldn't understand. Probably 'cos I'm too busy drinking joe with my bro like we came here to do in the first place, remember?"
Mordecai,Shh. Wait.
Man on TV,"I once was lost, but now I'm found. (Sprays cologne, and women tears the man's clothes off) DudeTime, for men."
Rigby,"Pssh. What kind of loser would want a bunch of chicks tearing their clothes off? Right, Mordecai?"
Margaret,Mordecai.
Mordecai,"Oh, hey Margaret. Didn't notice you there."
Margaret,"Gee Mordecai, I don't think I've ever realized how awesome you are. And you smell great too. Mordecai? Mordecai?"
Rigby,Mordecai? Mordecai?
Mordecai,"Dude, I'm buying that cologne."
Rigby,Agh! Why? You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.
Rigby,(Sings the theme song from the commercial) Bam! Now do want that game?
Mordecai,"No, I still want the cologne."
Rigby,If you buy that cologne then I'm gonna lose all respect for you.
Mordecai,Good. Then we'll both have the same amount of respect for each other.
Rigby,"Ugh! What's with you? We had a plan: coffee, Strong Johns, hang out!"
Mordecai,"Dude, we can hang out later. I just wanna go buy some that cologne really quick."
Rigby,"No, that wasn't part of the plan! If you leave, then I'm gonna have to get some new friends!"
Mordecai,That's cool. I'll probably be too busy with the ladies anyway.
Rigby,Well fine. I'll be busy with my new friends! Plan-breaker!
Rigby,Are you done with your stupid cologne yet? You know that stuff's not gonna work.
Mordecai,Why don't you get out of here? You don't know anything.
Pops,"Mordecai, Rigby, wonderful day we're hav--. (He smells something funky, which is the cologne, and he runs away squealing in horror.)"
Rigby,(laughs) In your face! I knew that stuff wasn't gonna work.
Mordecai,"Shut up! I'm not trying to attract Pops, I'm trying to attract Margaret. She's probably on her way right now. (Sprays more of the cologne, while Rigby is coughing, and the cologne attracts a haze.) Margaret? I'm over here. Margar--? (Spots a Unicorn behind him) Oh, geez!"
st Unicorn,(sniffs) Whaddaya got there?
Mordecai,DudeTime?
st Unicorn,"Aw, I knew it! Come out, bros, come out! I told you it was DudeTime!"
th Unicorn,Alright! DudeTime!
th Unicorn,"Yeah! DudeTime, bros!!"
th Unicorn,Yo! Did someone say there's DudeTime down here?
st Unicorn,"Can I bum a spray, can I bum a spray?"
Mordecai,Who are these guys?
Rigby,"I dunno. They seem pretty cool, though!"
th Unicorn,You bros wanna hang out?
Rigby,(gasps) I wanna hang out! But you're wasting your time with this guy. All he wants to do is get with Margaret.
st Unicorn,Margaret? That doesn't sound like a dude's name. Are you using DudeTime to get the ladies?
Mordecai,"Yeah, so what?"
st Unicorn,"Aw no, bro! You don't use this to get the ladies. You use it to hang out with the bros!"
Unicorns,Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros!
Rigby,"Yeah, hee hee! Finally somebody's speaking my language! (Rigby joins in with the chant of Bros.)"
st Unicorn,"Haw haw! Little dude makes me laugh. Seriously though. You're pretty cool, too, for letting us bum some of your DudeTime, so... if you really wanna attract the ladies, we can help."
Mordecai,Really?
st Unicorn,"Aw, yeah. We know all about the ladies."
Mordecai,"Actually, uh, that would be pretty awesome, guys."
st Unicorn,Cool. Just point us to the lady.
Mordecai,"Well, this is where she works. What do I gotta do?"
st Unicorn,"Oh, we'll tell you what to do, but first you have to drink from the Cup of Knowledge."
Mordecai,"Aw, sick. What was that?!"
st Unicorn,It's definitely not unicorn slomp! (The Unicorns high-five. The 7th Unicorn has arrived by this point)
Mordecai,How is that supposed to get me a lady?
st Unicorn,"Chill out, bro. We're just having a little fun."
Rigby,"Yeah, fun! Ever hear of it?"
Mordecai,Quit bein' such a jerk!
st Unicorn,Come on! We won't mess with you anymore. I promise. Got a great way to help you get your lady.
Mordecai,Great. As long as I don't have to stand next to that total loser I'm up for anything.
Rigby,Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meeeeeh.!
st Unicorn,"'Kay, check it: the ladies love dudes who slick their hair back. Jimmy, give 'im the stuff."
th Unicorn,"Here, use this!"
Mordecai,"Huh, fine."
Mordecai,Are you sure she'll be into this?
st Unicorn,"Totally, bro, she'll be all about it. All you gotta do is lay it down."
Mordecai,Lay it... down.
st Unicorn,"Yeah, bro, you know: lay it down!"
Margaret,Can I help you?
Mordecai,"(nervously) H-hey, Margaret..."
Margaret,Mordecai?
Margaret,"Oh, hey! What's up?"
Mordecai,"I'm uh, I'm here to... lay it down."
Margaret,What?
Mordecai,Lay it... down?
Margaret,Um. Sure. Are you feeling OK?
Mordecai,"Yeah, I'm great, uh, I'll be right back."
Mordecai,"What the H, guys? Not cool!"
st Unicorn,"Chill out, bro! We were watching you in there and little dude had a really good point."
Mordecai,What point?
st Unicorn,That we're totally not hanging out enough.
Mordecai,"Aw, jeez."
st Unicorn,Don't worry. We're still gonna help you get your lady.
Mordecai,How?
st Unicorn,By partying at your place!
Mordecai,(screaming) Wait what?!
Rigby,Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Mordecai,"Dude, these guys aren't trying to help me. They're just messing with me."
Rigby,"Dude, they're just partying."
Mordecai,How is this supposed to help me get the ladies?
Rigby,They got you a lady!
Mordecai,That's not a lady.
Mordecai,"Hey, I thought you were gonna help me with Margaret."
st Unicorn,(angrily) Something's touching me!
Rigby,"Hey, bros, check this out. (Approaches Mordecai) Here, let me help you up. (He pulls his hand away at the last second.) Psych! Why don't you ask Margaret to help you up? Ohhhhh!"
Mordecai,"You know what, Rigby? Have fun with your new friends, you jerk. Oh, and just so you know, when Benson finds out about your friends and their little hangout time, he's probably gonna fire ya. Later, bro."
Rigby,"(worried) Mordecai, wait!"
th Unicorn,(from upstairs) Bros! I found a trampoline!
Rigby,No! (Rigby runs up to his room) What are you doing to my bed?
th Unicorn,"You sleep on this, bro?!"
Rigby,Get off it!
th Unicorn,"Right after this somersault. (The unicorn flips in mid air and his horn rips the trampoline, falling to the floor.) Bros, this trampoline's all over me. Help me get it off!"
Rigby,My bed!
st Unicorn,"Hey, bro. You know this nerd?"
Benson,Hrrgrh! Rgh! Rrrghhlllghg! Mmmmnnnggghllgh! (probably) Rigby! When I get out of here I'll kill you!
st Unicorn,"Check this out. (He gets some gumballs out of Benson and eats them) What's the matter, Rigbone? You like that nerd or something?"
rd Unicorn,"(slaps Rigby) Yeah, dude. Chill out. (Elbows Rigby) And have a drink! (He sprays Rigby with a soda can, temporarily blinding Rigby. In his confusion, Rigby stumbles between the unicorns, who have formed a circle with the intention of repeatedly farting on him)"
Rigby,"Hey, Mordecai."
Mordecai,Don't touch me!
Rigby,"Heh, huh... So, I sorta need your help."
Mordecai,Why don't you ask your new bros for help?
Rigby,"Dude, get over it! It's not my fault! If you would have just hung out with me and played some Strong Johns, none of this woulda happened."
Mordecai,"Look, I'm sorry about the game, but that doesn't give you the right to treat me like garbage! (yells) You owe me an apology!"
Rigby,"(avoiding eye contact, speaking quickly and quietly) I'm sorry."
Mordecai,A real apology.
Rigby,"OK, I'm sorry. I'm... sorry! (screaming) Is that what you want to hear? (screaming louder) I MISS YOU!!!! I miss you...! (Rigby looks like he's about to cry)"
Mordecai,"OK, quit being a baby. (He punches Rigby in the arm)"
Rigby,Ahh! Why?!
Mordecai,That's for psyching me.
Mordecai,It's gonna suck for you when Benson gets untied.
Rigby,"Dude, you have to help me."
Mordecai,"Way ahead of you, bro."
Mordecai and Rigby,Hey Skips.
Rigby,We have a problem.
Skips,Unicorns?
Rigby,How'd you know?
Skips,They peed on my lawn.
Mordecai,"So, how do we get rid of them?"
Skips,"Well, that's really hard. They're like insects, but... (hefts his weights onto the bar and sits up) there's one thing unicorns never say no to. (He motions for Rigby to hand him a towel - Rigby does so and Skips wipes his face with it. We zoom in close to Skips' face) Drag racing."
Skips,"You guys know what to do, right?"
Rigby,Yeah.
Mordecai,"(loudly, so the unicorns can hear) Hey, Rigby. Weren't we supposed to race some unicorns, and not a bunch of losers?"
Unicorns,You're dead! You're gonna die!
Pops,Horseless carriages...
Pops,... commence!
Skips,This is how you get rid of unicorns.
Rigby,But what if they come back?
Benson,They ain't comin' back!
Rigby,(sparkles in their eyes) Cool!
Benson,That's the only way to get rid of unicorns.
Benson,"I can't believe you idiots let those unicorns in here! You two morons (In the UK, Morons is changed to Idiots.) had better get this mess cleaned up, or you'll wish it was YOU DRIVING THAT CAR!!!"
Rigby,The unicorn one? (Benson sprays Rigby with the hose and Rigby screams) Coooooollld!
Benson,(to Mordecai) And you! (Mordecai screams as he shakes in fear) Quit spraying that cologne! It's not gonna get you any ladies. Idiots... (walks away)
Mordecai,Wanna go... bro?
Rigby,Strong Johns?
Mordecai,Yeah.
Game Voice,D-d-d-d-d-da-Dig Champs!
Rigby,"Dude, these are probably the best graphics I've ever seen in my life."
Mordecai,"Dude, it looks just like the cover."
Mordecai,"Oh man. Dude, let's play it."
Rigby,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't play game like this right out of the box. We should stretch it out first."
Rigby,"We don't want to pull our hammies, know what I'm saying?"
Rigby,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Mordecai,Starting. Hurry up and pick your character. (laughs)
Rigby,"Aw, what? I wanted to be Player One!"
Mordecai,"Dude, I'm Player One. You're Player Two."
Rigby,I don't wanna be Player Two! He just digs with the sucky pickaxe! I want the one with the shovel!
Mordecai,"Dude, they're exactly the same!"
Rigby,Then why don't you be Player Two?
Mordecai,"Pfft, I'm not using that sucky pickaxe."
Rigby,(gasps) See!?
Mordecai,"Dude, calm down. Let's play punchies to see who gets to be Player One."
Rigby,Fine.
Mordecai,Looks like I'm Player One.
Rigby,No!
Rigby,"It's not fair, you always get your way!"
Rigby,"""Let's play punchies! Let's play punchies!"" I'm sick of it! Of course I'm not gonna beat you at punchies!"
Mordecai,"Dude, you don't beat anybody at punchies."
Rigby,"Yes, I do!"
Mordecai,"No, you don't."
Mordecai,"Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, wee-ooh! ""Quick, doctor! Both of these buttcheeks are unrecognizable! If we want anybody to be able to recognize this as a butt in the future, then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!"""
Rigby,Stop talking!! There was only damage to the one cheek and you know it!
Mordecai,"(laughs) That's right! We used to call you the One Cheek Wonder! Dude, I'm bringing it back."
Rigby,You better not!
Muscle Man,Is that One Cheek Wonder? I hope he's not trying to play punchies with cheeks like that!
Rigby,Shut up! Don't look at them!
Rigby,"I'll win at punchies, you'll see!"
Rigby,Dumb Mordecai! I hate you!
Mordecai,You better not be messing up my side of the room!
Rigby,You're ruining my life!
Rigby,Stupid bo - book?
Rigby,"Death Kwon Do? ""Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments! Unlock your full potential today?"""
Rigby,Yes!
Sensai,"It's a touching story. Really, it is. But I don't know if you're ready for Death Kwon Do."
Rigby,Why not?
Sensai,"Death Kwon Do is all about self-defense. But from the sound of it, you just want to hit harder."
Rigby,"Uh, no? Can you just teach me something?"
Sensai,"Hmm, determination. I like that. Okay, I'll teach you some beginner defensive moves. All you gotta do is pick from the sacred text of Death Kwon Do."
Sensai,"Let's see, we could start you off with the Bicep Flex of Death. Or there's the Leg Lifts of Death, that's a good beginner's move. Or the Pelvic Thrust of Death, that's one of my personal favorites."
Rigby,That one. That's the one I want: The Death Punch.
Sensai,"That, I'm afraid, is not for beginners."
Rigby,"What, why!?"
Sensai,Because you only wanna use it to beat up your friends. You're not pure of heart!
Rigby,What!? Don't call me not pure of heart! What about you with your crappy mullet? You're the one who's not pure of heart!
Sensai,That's it!
Sensai,"I'm turning my back on you and counting to three...of death. And when I turn back around, you're toast!"
Sensai,One...of death. Two...of death.
Sensai,N-n-nooooooooo!!
Student,"Um, Sensai? Um, I think somebody just Death Kwon Clogged the toilet."
Sensai,Nooooooooo!!
Rigby,Whoa...time to take this baby for a test drive.
and he looks around to find his first victim,"He spots Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost walking past with a wheelbarrow. Rigby runs up to them and does the Death Punch, blasting them away. Muscle Man crashes into a building and flops over, so that his butt is stuck in his face)"
Muscle Man,"Oh no, bro..."
Rigby,"You're next, Mordecai!"
Mordecai,"""Do, do, do-do, do-do!"" Alright, Rigby. Crybaby time's over. Come on, let's go get some food, I'm buying."
Mordecai,"Aw, what!?"
Mordecai,Rigby! Ugh! He's gonna pay for this.
Mordecai,Death Kwon Do?
Rigby,"Where are you, Mordecai!? I wanna play you punchies!"
Rigby,"Hey, mister! Have you seen Mordecai?"
Rigby,Have you seen him?
Rigby,How about you?
Mordecai,"Oh, so you think you're gonna beat me at punchies? Well, I got news for you. I know your little secret."
Rigby,Now massage this foot!
Skips,But I already did that one.
Rigby,"Then rub it again! Unless you wanna get punched again? And Pops, what's with the easy-breezy? Speed it up, my pepperonis are roasting down here!"
Rigby,"Muscle Man, do you see Mordecai yet?"
Muscle Man,"Uh, I can't see anything."
Mordecai,"I'm right here, Rigby."
Rigby,Gimme those!
Rigby,Looks like you learned the ways of Death Kwon Do.
Mordecai,Looks like you know how to say things that people are already aware of.
Rigby,Whatever. You can't handle the Death Punch.
Mordecai,That sounds like a challenge.
Rigby,That's because maybe it is a challenge.
Mordecai,"Well then, what are you doing up there?"
Rigby,Muscle Man! Hi Fives! Carry me down.
Rigby,"Don't drop me. Be careful. Whoa, whoa! Leaning, leaning!"
Rigby,Here! Here! Set me here.
Rigby,What move did you learn?
Mordecai,Why don't you come over here and find out?
Rigby,What?
Rigby,How come you're not dead yet?
Mordecai,Probably because I learned the Death Block.
Mordecai,It worked pretty good for a first try. Either that or your Death Punch totally blows.
Rigby,I'll kill you!!
Mordecai,"Hmph, hmph. You're never gonna beat me at punchies."
Mordecai,Are you finished yet?
Rigby,Not until I smash you!
Mordecai,Whoa.
Rigby,What? Are you afraid of a little lava?
Mordecai,"Dude, this is serious! We gotta get out of here!"
Rigby,Never! Not until I beat you at punchies!
Mordecai,"Dude, stop! We're gonna die!"
Rigby,I don't care! I'm sick of you always winning!
Rigby,I'm not quitting 'till I win!
Mordecai,"Ahh! You got me! You got me! Ahh, you got me. You win. We have to stop now 'cause I lost."
Rigby,"Ha! I told you I was gonna win! In your face! Yay, I finally get to be Player One!"
Mordecai,What!? That's what this is about? You just wanted to be Player One?
Rigby,That's all I ever wanted!
Mordecai,"Dude, you can totally be Player One."
Mordecai,"Dude, quit crying. I said you could be Player One."
Rigby,"I know, but what good is being Player One now? We're just gonna die in this lava!"
Mordecai,"Don't worry, dude. I can get us away from the lava."
Rigby,Really? How!?
Mordecai,You think I'm dumb enough to only steal one Death Kwon Do move?
Rigby,Wha'?
Mordecai,"Now, how do you wanna get out of here? The Death Jump or the Death Dump?"
Rigby,"Aw, sick! Better go with the Death Jump."
Mordecai,Hold on tight.
Pops,Look!
Sensai,"Why yes, sir. I have the Death Jump and the Death Dump, right he-"
Sensai,Nooooo-
Game Voice,D-d-d-d-d-da-Dig Champs!
Rigby,"Aw, yes! It's finally happening!"
Mordecai,"Yep. For once, being a huge baby actually worked out for you."
Rigby,Stop talking!
Mordecai,"Heheheh. Dude, just hurry up and play. You're just gonna die right at the beginning anyway."
Rigby,"""Mememememememememememe!"" (grunts) I'll show you."
Rigby,"Aw, what? Snails are bad? I thought snails were good!"
Mordecai,"No, dude. Snails are bad."
Rigby,"Aw, man. This sucks. I wanna be Player Two."
Rigby,"(Laughing) Dude! I'm open, I'm open, dude!"
Mordecai,"(Snickers) Go long, dude!"
Rigby,"Touchdown, sock faces!"
Benson,"Hey, you two! Quit fooling around; we're having an emergency meeting."
Mordecai,"Aw, what?"
Rigby,Boo!
Benson,"(Signals to the door) Outside, now!"
Benson,"Alright, everyone. I got some bad news. The park is being audited. (points to Pops) Pops tried to pay the park's taxes... (gives Pops a look) ...with lollipops."
Pops,But I gave them more than enough.
Benson,"We already went over this, Pops. You pay taxes with money, not lollipops."
Pops,(Sad) Oh.
Rigby,(Blows his lips) What's the big deal? It's not like an audit is a bad thing.
Benson,"It is a bad thing, Rigby! If we don't take care of this, the government takes our stuff away."
Benson,"OK, we only have till 3 to stop the audit. (Slowly pan over to Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, who are thinking up something funny.) Does anyone know someone who can help us? Anybody? Anybody at all?"
Muscle Man,(Raises his hand) I know someone who can help.
Benson,"(threatening) If you say your mom, you're fired!"
Muscle Man,(Long pause) MY MOM!
Benson,GET OUT!!
Muscle Man,It was worth it!
Mordecai,(Thinks) Hmmm... Hmph. Hey! (looks at Rigby) We know someone.
Rigby,We do?
Rigby,No! No way!
Benson,"What? If you know somebody, you've got to tell me."
Mordecai,Rigby has a brother. (Rigby punches Mordecai.) And he's an accountant. (Rigby punches Mordecai rapidly.)
Rigby,Shut up!
Mordecai,"Dude, what do you have against Don?"
Young Rigby,Guys! Guys! Guys!
Young Don,"Hey, Rigby. Happy birthday, bro."
Young Rigby,Wha? Wha? I told you to stay in the basement!
Young Don,"Oh. Sorry, Rigby. I just wanted to give you some birthday sugar."
Young Rigby,I don't want your freakinâ€™ sugar!
Young Rigby,Don't you dare!
Young Mordecai,"I'm just getting some sugar, dude. (Rigby lets go of him.) Besides, Don is cool."
Rigby Friend,"You're the best, Don!"
Mordecai,Yeah. Don really made that party.
Benson,Call your brother!
Rigby,No!
Benson,Call your brother!
Rigby,No! I hate him!
Benson,"Fine. (To Mordecai) Mordecai, you call him."
Rigby,You better not!
Mordecai,"Dude, he could save the park!"
Rigby,"Dude, he could ruin my life! If he comes, I'm gonna tell him to leave!"
Benson,"(Walks up to Rigby) No, you won't! You be nice to your brother or you're FIRED! (To Mordecai) Call him. (He walks off.)"
Mordecai,"(Pats Rigby) Dude, just be cool until he stops the audit."
Rigby,Grrrr!
Rigby,You guys are making a big mistake.
Benson,"Don't ruin this for us, Rigby."
Benson,Really nice car.
Pops,He looks just like Rigby.
Don,(Gets out of his car) Did somebody order an accountant?
Benson,Thank you so much for coming on such short notice. I'm Benson.
Don,"Benson. Give me some sugar. (Hugs Benson) Nice to meet you. Hey, who's this guy?"
Pops,I'm Pops.
Don,Pops. Give me some sugar.
Don,Don. Good to meet ya.
Don,"Look at this sugar shack. Come here, guy (Gives Mordecai a hug) I haven't seen you in forever."
Mordecai,"(Chuckles) Yeah, I know! Oh, it's been forever."
Don,"Rigby. Give me some sugar, bro."
Rigby,Don't you have taxis to do? Why don't you get to it?
Don,(Chuckles) Oh. He was always greedy with the sugar.
Rigby,Augh! I can't wait for you to get out of my life!
Don,"What, bro?"
Benson,(Angrily whispers to Rigby) You keep your mouth shut!
Rigby,(flinching) Nothing.
Don,"So then I said, ""You're not an accountant, you're an account-can't!"""
Pops,I didn't realize accounting could be so fascinating!
Don,I'm just lucky I get to do what I love.
Rigby,"(Mocking Don) ""Ohh, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love."""
Don,(Turns around) Rigbone. Sugar?
Rigby,Shouldn't you be fixing the augite?
Don,You mean the audit?
Rigby,Don't correct me! I know what it is!
Don,"(Laughing) Whoa, there. I'm sensing some tension, bro. I think it's time we all take a well-deserved break."
Don,Mordo! Go long!
Mordecai,I got it!
Rigby,"Hello, ""Mordo"". Enjoying your game?"
Mordecai,"Uh, sure, dude. Can you pass the ball?"
Mordecai,(Grunts) Rigby!
Rigby,He's not even doing the debit!
Mordecai,"It's audit! (Sighs) Rigby, why don't you just try being nice to your brother? He's actually pretty cool."
Rigby,You don't get it! He...
Don,"Hey, Mordo! We playing or what?"
Mordecai,"Uh, yeah, coming!"
Don,"Ah, I just about got this. With a few minutes to spare. (Rigby walks in.) Rigbone. How about a little pre-saving the park sugar? You know? for almost being done saving the park?"
Rigby,NO!
Don,What's going on with us? You never give me some sugar. Did I do something?
Rigby,Yeah. You were born!
Don,(visibly hurt) Wow. That's heavy. I gotta get out of here.
Mordecai,"Dude? No, wait Don!"
Don,I'm sorry. I just... gotta get out of here!
Mordecai,"Dude, what are you doing? He was almost done!"
Rigby,"Ah, he's not so cool."
Rigby,OK. (He presses another button and more ads pop up. The screen turns red and vibrates dangerously.) Augh! Mordecai! Help!
Mordecai,What did you do?
Rigby,I don't know!
Mordecai,This doesn't make any sense.
Rigby,"No, no, no!"
Benson,Don? We brought you a cake. It's almost three. Were you able to stop the audit?
Rigby,"(Imitates Don, badly) Uh, almost done, Benson-bone. (Normal voice, to Mordecai) How do I send this thing?"
Mordecai,"No dude, call your brother back."
Rigby,No! I hate him!
Mordecai,Don't... Don't send it! Don't!
Rigby,Augh! Must... push... send!
Rigby,Crap!
Computer,You are late. Begin audit.
Pops,"Oh, my..."
Benson,"Where's Don?! (Outside, Don is shown driving away, almost crying. The others run out after him.) Don! Wait! (To the others) What happened?"
Mordecai,Rigby blew it! He wouldn't give Don sugar.
Benson,(Furious) What?! Go give him some sugar!
Rigby,(Even more furious) NEVER!
Mordecai,Rigby? Rigby! (He looks for Rigby and eventually sees his tail poking out from under a pile of clothes on his trampoline.) Rigby!
Rigby,(In a sad voice) Rigby's not here right now.
Mordecai,Quit being so selfish! (Moves clothing out of the way) The park is disappearing! We have to end this.
Rigby,"Don't tell me what to do! You don't know what it's like to have a brother, so you don't know!"
Mordecai,"You're right. I don't have a brother. But I kinda know what it's like... 'cause I have you, dude. You're like my brother."
Rigby,(Climbing out from under a t-shirt) Really?
Mordecai,"Yeah. You're to me like Don is to you. I think you're kinda awkward to look at, and you embarrass me all the time, and I wish I could trade you in for someone else. But I don't. Because you're like my brother. With brothers you always gotta make do. And I think you should make do, too."
Don,"Look, I'm glad you guys stopped by but... I just can't finish the audit. I'm sorry."
Rigby,"Don, please! I need your help with the audit, bro."
Don,Why is it so hard for you to give me sugar? (Almost crying) Why do you hate me?
Mordecai,He's mad about the birthday party.
Rigby,No! It wasn't just the birthday party. It's everything.
Mordecai and Rigby are in a photo booth,"Rigby looks angry as Mordecai beckons Don in as well. Photos are shown in which Mordecai and Don are front and center, and Rigby struggles to be seen at the back. The montage ends.)"
Don,"I... I had no idea. I'm sorry, bro. I didn't mean to steal your friends. I was just trying to be cool like you."
Rigby,Huh?
Don,"I've always looked up to you, bro. I get my hair cut like you, I try to look like you, and I don't wear clothes, just like you. Remember when you started walking around naked? I thought you were so cool."
Mordecai,"Yeah, dude. That was pretty cool."
Don,Alright. Let's go save your park.
Don,Where's the computer?
Don,"Jeez! What did you do, bro?"
Rigby,I tried to do the taxis!
Don,Hold on. This is gonna be close.
Don,"Alright, I got it! I just have to do one more thing."
Rigby,Do it!
Rigby,Why isn't anything happening?
Don,"Because... (Stands up and turns around, arms outstretched) I still need some sugar, bro."
Rigby,WHAT?
Everyone except Rigby,(Angrily) Rigby!
Mordecai,"Aw, Don. Do you have to leave already?"
Don,"Sorry, Mordo, but an accountant's work is never done."
Benson,"Thanks for everything, Don."
Pops,Do come back soon!
Skips,Mmhmm.
Don,"Well, big brother, if you ever need some sugar, you know who to call."
Don,"Later, gators."
Mordecai,(Leaning in to Rigby with a giant smirk on his face) Sugar?
Rigby,Shut up!
Rigby,"Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man! Mordecai, check it out! I found it in the trash in the back. Isn't it cool?"
Mordecai,"Dude, you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash. It's unnatural."
Rigby,"You're unnatural! Besides, this is different. It's a treasure from the past."
Mordecai,It is a pretty sweet plate.
Rigby,We should put some food on this baby!
Mordecai,"Hmm, hmm. Agreed. You know what would look great on this plate? Chocolate cake!"
Rigby,"Ahhhhh, yes. But how can we afford something as good as chocolate cake?"
Mordecai,"Don't worry, dude. I think I know where we can get one."
Rigby,"I can't wait to eat that greasy pig. Wait, how much does it cost?"
Mordecai,(Looks at the box) A buck fifty.
Rigby,Aaaargh!
Rigby,I told you cake mix is too expensive.
Doorman,Do you know the bride or the groom?
Mordecai and Rigby,Uhhh..
Mordecai,The one with the cake?
Mordecai and Rigby,Ugghhh!!
Cashier at the free store,"Yeah, we don't have cakes."
Mordecai,"(Sighs) Well, I'm all out of ideas."
Rigby,Ooh! I got it! There's that chocolate cake at the snack bar!
Mordecai,"Yeah. But, Benson will only let you have it for free if it's your birthday."
Rigby,Who's to say it's not my birthday?
Mordecai,Who's to say it's not my birthday?
Rigby,Free cake! Free cake!
Benson,It's neither of your birthdays.
Rigby,"Aw, man! He's killing us with that!"
Rigby,(Sadly) No cake. No cake.
Pops,But it is Skips' birthday.
Rigby,Free cake! Free cake!
Benson,But he's really private about it.
Rigby,(Sadly) No cake. No cake.
Benson,"Come to think of it, I don't think we've ever had a party for Skips."
Pops,"If memory serves, Skips secludes himself in the woods every year on the day of his birth."
Mordecai,"So, wait? You guys have never thrown a party for Skips?"
Benson,No.
Mordecai,"Dude, that sucks. Skips totally deserves a party."
Rigby,(Who interrupts) And cake.
Mordecai,"Whenever something goes wrong, it's Skips who fixes it. Heâ€™s always there for us, no matter what. I bet Skips wants a party, but he's such a quiet guy he doesn't know how to ask. We owe him a party."
Rigby,And also a cake.
Pops,"Woo! Good show, jolly good show! Benson, a soiree for Skips, what a crackerjack idea!"
Benson,"You're right. Fine. If you two get Skips on board, we'll throw a party for him."
Mordecai,"Oh, we know how to get him on board."
Rigby,"Oh, I know! Let's get a van."
Dream Rigby,"Happy birthday, Skips."
Rigby,BAM! Free cake!
Mordecai,"No, dude. Thatâ€™s kidnapping."
Rigby,"But we can't just tell him. You heard Benson, Skips isn't into this stuff."
Mordecai,"I know, but dude, Skips is cool. We should just go and tell him we gonna throw him a party."
Rigby,"Argh, laaaame!"
Mordecai,What? What's wrong with that?
Rigby,"Two things: one, no surprise, and two, no vans."
Mordecai,(gasp) That's it.
Rigby,"What, vans?"
Mordecai,"No, Surprise. Dude, we should throw Skips a surprise party!"
Rigby,"Dude, that's perfect!"
Mordecai,"Yeah, I know. 'Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party."
Rigby,'Cause they can't.
Mordecai and Rigby,Free cake! Free cake!
Skips,"No, I don't wanna hang out with you guys at 8 o'clock tonight."
Mordecai,"Well, then... How about later tonight?"
Skips,No! I wanna be left alone!
Mordecai,"Argh, man. What would we do now?"
Rigby,"Dude, Check it. We'll just lie to Benson and get the cake first, and figure out the Skips part later."
Mordecai,"Hmm, hmm. Sounds like a cake worthy idea to me."
Mordecai and Rigby,Free cake! Free cake!
Mordecai,Skips totally wants a birthday party.
Benson,Really? How did you convince him?
Mordecai,We told him there's gonna be cake.
Rigby,"Yeah, he wants an extra-large chocolate one."
Benson,Really?
Mordecai,Yeah. 8:00. His place.
Rigby,"But he wants it to be a surprise, so if you see him, don't say anything. (Mordecai punches Rigby.) Ow!"
Benson,"Okay. Here's the key to the cake in the snack bar. I guess Iâ€™ll see you at 8. But if you morons are lying to me, you'll be on dish duty for the next month!!"
Mordecai,We did it!
Rigby,Let's eat it!
Mordecai,No! You heard Benson. Do you wanna be on dish duty?
Rigby,"Arghhhhhhh, fine. We'll do dish duty."
Mordecai,"No, dude. We have to get Skips."
Rigby,Are you sure Skips is even here?
Mordecai,Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods. Where else should we look? (Rigby's stomach rumbles.) Don't touch that cake.
Rigby,It's a medical emergency.
Mordecai,You just ate a sandwich.
Rigby,Are you a doctor now? Did you go to medical school in the past 5 minutes?
Mordecai,"We're saving it for the party, and that's THAT."
Benson,Do you see them?
Pops,Not yet.
Benson,Hit the lights. It's almost 8 p.m.
Muscle Man,Whooooo! Skips is gonna be so surprised when he comes in and sees us totally naked.
Benson,"It's not that kind of party, Muscle Man."
Muscle Man,Ohhhh... Don't turn on the lights.
Rigby,"Ohhhh, man, it's almost 8. We're not gonna find him, let's just eat it."
Mordecai,"No. Benson's gonna get pissed, so we shouldnâ€™t. (In reruns, the line is changed to ""Benson's gonna get ticked, so we shouldn't."")"
Rigby,Benson's gonna get like that no matter what. (Grabs the cake from Mordecai.) Better to have no regrets.
Mordecai,"Dude! No! (Grabs the cake back. Rigby jumps on Mordecai trying to get the cake.) RIGBY! GET OFF! (Mordecai throws Rigby off and tries to run away with the cake, but Rigby gets him. They fight over the cake.) Dude! Quit it! You're ruining the cake! (A mysterious sound is heard.) Wait. What's that? Sounds like some kind of weird Aztec ritual... (Mordecai and Rigby stop fighting. While Mordecai was puzzling over the sound Rigby sneakily obtained the cake.) I think it's coming from over there. We should go to check it out."
Rigby,"That's funny. Usually, if there's a strange noise in the woods, you don't check it out. Mordecai? (They see Skips singing and jumping around a blue-colored bonfire with a big rattle.) What's Skips doing?"
Mordecai,I don't know. But it looks kind of important. Maybe we should leave him alone.
Rigby,What about the cake?
Mordecai,Would you forget about the cake for a minute? Rigby!
Rigby,"You're coming with us, Skips!"
Skips,What are you doing?!? (The bonfire goes out.) Fools! You interrupted my spirit dance! You don't realize what you've done!
Gary,Skips. You have broken the pact with the Guardians of Youth.
Skips,"Gary, You don't have to do this!"
Gary,Listen. I'm just doing my job.
Mordecai,Wait! Where are you taking him?
Gary,I'm only the chauffeur.
Mordecai,"Dude, I think we just screwed Skips!"
Rigby,"And ourselves! No Skips, no cake!"
Mordecai,Come on. We better follow him. (They jump into the trunk. The pickup arrives onto a sandy island in the space.) Dude. What the...
Rigby,Dude. What's with the babies? We've got to get Skips back to the park.
Mordecai,Shh! Shut up!
Gary,Guardians of Eternal Youth. I have brought you the condemned.
Guardian of Eternal Youth,"Skips. You have failed to complete the Spirit Dance. And thus the pact you made with us for eternal youth has been broken. Now you shall shrivel into dust and disappear, Forever."
Mordecai and Rigby,SKIPS!!!!!
Mordecai,Wait! It's not his fault!
Guardian of Eternal Youth,What's done is done.
Mordecai,But this is our fault! We interrupted the dance before he could finish!
Rigby,"Yeah, man. Let him finish that dance thing!"
Guardian of Eternal Youth,The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned.
Rigby,SKIPS!!!!!
Mordecai,"We're sorry, Skips."
Rigby,"Yeah, we're sorry."
Mordecai,(sniffles) We just wanna to throw you a surprise party.
Rigby,Yeah. It was going to be really cool. We were gonna eat cake...
Guardian of Eternal Youth,Cake? Did someone say cake?
Rigby,No. Thereâ€™s no cake.
Guardian of Eternal Youth,"Wait, brothers. I smell cake. Do you smell it as well?"
Mordecai,Wait. You guys like cake?
Guardians of Eternal Youth,Yes! Yes! We love it!
Mordecai,"Give me the cake, dude."
Rigby,No way!
Mordecai,"So, you're telling me you like cake?"
Guardian of Eternal Youth,The blue one has cake. Cake. Give us the cake!
Mordecai,"Nah, The cake for Skips."
Rigby,"Mordecai, what are you doing?"
Mordecai,Dude. Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?
Rigby,Alright.
Mordecai,Do we have a deal?
Guardian of Eternal Youth,What flavor is it?
Mordecai,Chocolate.
Guardian of Eternal Youth,"We have reached a new decision. We will restore Skips' youth in exchange, for your cake."
Mordecai,Now change him back!
Guardian of Eternal Youth,Done!
Rigby,"Aw, what? They are not even eating it! They're just smushing it on their faces!"
Guardian of Eternal Youth,Be gone with you.
Hi Five Ghost,Surprise!
Pops,Let the merry making commence! (laughs)
Skips,You guys almost killed me for some cake?
Rigby,"Hey, Skips. We've got you a birthday present. (Rigby gives Skips the plate he found in a trash.) It says: SKIPS --- GODFATHER OF SOUL."
Skips,No one's ever thrown me a birthday party before. Thanks.
Benson,"So, where's the cake?"
Mordecai,"Ahh, cake?"
Rigby,I don't remember anything about cake.
Mordecai,Me neither.
Rigby,Must be a misunderstanding.
Mordecai,"Oh, The cake from the snack bar."
Rigby,You wanted that cake for this party?
Mordecai,"Ha-ha-ha! Oh, man! I mean what a mix-up, right?"
Rigby,The important thing is we are all together.
Benson,"Argh. I knew I couldn't trust you idiots. You're lucky Pops brought a spare. Happy birthday, Skips."
Mordecai,"Ha-ha! Yes! Finally! (Takes a piece of the cake.) Argh, Vanilla...?"
Rigby,"Mordecai! Mordecai! Oh, there you are. You want half of this grilled cheese?"
Mordecai,Whoa! Is that a Grilled Cheese Deluxe from Cheezer's?
Rigby,"Yes, it is."
Mordecai,"Then, yes."
Mordecai,How did you manage this?
Rigby,I bought it. With money.
Mordecai,"Nice! Hey, you know what would go good with these sandwiches? Funny internet videos! Dude, check this out. (Begins typing in name on the keyboard)"
Rigby,"No, wait! I know a really good one. (Types on the keyboard)"
Mordecai,"No, man! Youâ€™re just gonna pull up that ostrich thing with the balls again."
Rigby,"No, Iâ€™m not."
Mordecai,Youâ€™re typing it in! I see it!
Rigby,"Dude, donâ€™t look! Youâ€™re gonna ruin it!"
Mordecai,Fine. It better not be that ostrich thing with the balls. Ready yet?
Rigby,Itâ€™s loading. Okay... Now!
Woman,"(In video, off-screen) Donâ€™t get too close now, Pa!"
Mordecai,"Man, itâ€™s that ostrich thing with the balls! Why do you gotta lie to me, dude?"
Rigby,â€˜Cause lyingâ€™s my specialty.
Benson,What are you doing with my sandwich?!
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,Donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll take care of this with my specialty. This isnâ€™t your sandwich. This is our sandwich.
Benson,"This is your sandwich, huh? Then how come it says ""Benson"" on the bag?"
Rigby,"Huh? itâ€™s supposed to say ""Rigby,"" but they misspelled my name wrong."
Benson,STOP LYING!!!
Mordecai,"Dude, I thought you said you bought this!"
Benson,"No, he didn't buy it! Now get off your lazy butts and go get me another GRILLED CHEESE DELUXE!!! (Slams the door shut)"
Mordecai,Argh! You ruined our day off!
Rigby,"Ah, donâ€™t worry, dude. The line wonâ€™t be that long."
Mordecai,"Thanks for saving the day with your specialty, you idiot."
Rigby,Whatever. Like you could do any better.
Mordecai,Pfff. Iâ€™m a better liar than you are.
Rigby,"Oh, really? The only thing youâ€™re better than me at is being a big piece of-"
Mordecai,Hey! Argh! What the...? Those pork loins are cutting! Argh!
Fat woman,Excuse me! Those fine men are astronauts! They can cut in line. They fought for our country! Huh!
Rigby,"(Rises off the ground and gasps) Dude, hereâ€™s your chance to prove youâ€™re a better liar than me. Or maybe you canâ€™t? Look at your face. (Touches Mordecai's face all around) It must really eat you up inside to not be able to prove youâ€™re a better liar than me. â€˜Cause you can prove nothing. You, Canâ€™t, Prove, Anything!"
Mordecai,(Slaps away Rigby's hand and picks him up) Fine! You want me to prove Iâ€™m a better liar than you? Why wouldnâ€™t we see who is better in lying? Whoever gets caught first loses.
Rigby,Okay. Itâ€™s not like youâ€™re ever gonna lie better than thi-i-is...
Mordecai,"Ahem, excuse me, Miss."
Fat woman,What?
Mordecai,"We're astronauts. (They enter the Cheezerâ€™s, cutting in line.) Bam! I told you Iâ€™m a better liar than you!"
Rigby,"Woah, woah, woah! Step aside. Iâ€™ll show you how a real man lies. (Approaches a counter) Hey, baby. Give me a Grilled Cheese Deluxe and make it snappy, â€˜cause weâ€™re astronauts and we gotta get back up in space. Know what Iâ€™m sayinâ€™?"
s Cashier,"Oh, my. (Speaks using a loudspeaker) One Grilled Cheese Deluxe for the astronauts. (The announcement arouses the real astronautsâ€™ curiosity.) Thatâ€™ll be two fifty."
Rigby,Bam! Thatâ€™s a moon quarter. (Points to a quarter)
s Cashier,Oh! (Takes the money)
Rigby,"Hmm, hmm. See?"
Mordecai,"Dude, that was lame."
s Cashier,"Excuse me, sir. Your Grilled Cheese is ready."
Mordecai,Thanks. We gotta get this back to our astronaut captain. Know what Iâ€™m sayin'? Hmm! Hmm!
s Cashier,"Oh, is that your astronaut captain over there?"
Mordecai,Huh? (Sees Rigby talking with Barry & Jones) ARGHHHH!!! (Comes up to them)
Rigby,This is the guy.
Jones,(Very indignant) Youâ€™re the guy?
Mordecai,Iâ€™m...
Rigby,"Hmm, hmm!"
Mordecai,(Unsure) Iâ€™m the guy...
Jones,"(Suddenly, Jones turns very excited. He is about to shake Mordecaiâ€™s hand.) Well! Itâ€™s an honor to meet you, captain. Lieutenant Riggs here has told us a lot about you."
Barry,"Yeah, itâ€™s great to meet a couple of real fellow astronauts."
Jones,"So, what are you guys doing in this dump hole, anyways?"
Rigby,"Ah, you know. We're just pickin' up a Grilled Cheese for our commanding officer."
Barry,Ha-ha! I hear that.
Mordecai,"Ha, yeah. We were just getting ready to take it back to the compound."
Jones,Compound? We were just getting ready to go there ourselves. Wanna lift?
Mordecai,"Uh, sure. Weâ€™ll take a ride to the compound."
Jones,"Come to think of it, why havenâ€™t we seen you around the compound before...?"
Rigby,"Weâ€™ve just got back from a 10-year stand in the old shuttlecraft. Isnâ€™t that right, Captain Mordecai?"
Mordecai,Yeah. And weâ€™ve just transferred here. Itâ€™s our first day.
Jones,"Well, welcome! Weâ€™ll be glad to show you around. Now, I hope youâ€™re up to spend a 2.5 million dollars of taxpayersâ€™ money, â€˜cause weâ€™re drivinâ€™."
Jones,"Gentlemen, welcome to the compound! ('Compound' echos)"
Rigby,"Oh, uh, I forgot my ID in my other pants. Can you help me out, guys?"
Mordecai,"Oh, what? That was my ID! I told you not to lose it!"
Jones,"Guys, guys, calm down. You can use our IDs. (They pass the checkpoint.) Here. You, guys, might be more comfortable in these. (Passes them jackets)"
Rigby,"Ah, thanks. Yeah, I love these things, but Captain Mordecai might not be that into 'em. Donâ€™t you like the uniforms in pink?"
Jones,Pink?
Mordecai,I only had to borrow a pair that one time from... (Notices an employee list on the wall and quickly picks up a random name) Dr. Asinoskovich. That one time.
Jones,"Ah, you know Dr. Asinoskovich? Thatâ€™s funny. Because sheâ€™s right here. (Points at a woman standing with her back towards them)"
Asinoskovich,(Turns around and speaks with a Russian accent) I donâ€™t remember you.
Mordecai,Really? Uh... It was one time at that conference. You donâ€™t remember me?
Asinoskovich,Uh... I donâ€™t remember very much from that conference. I... have to go! (Runs away very quickly)
Jones,"Wow! That was awkward. Ah, come on. Weâ€™ll give you the grand tour."
Mordecai,"Dude, you should quit right now. Youâ€™re totally gonna get caught."
Rigby,"Hmm, hmm. Weâ€™ll see."
Rigby,"Man, I donâ€™t think you can last much longer. I think you should give it up."
Mordecai,They're not onto me.
Rigby,Then I guess itâ€™s time that I start lying at one hundred percent. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?!
Jones,"And what tour would be complete without a stop at the pride of our compound --- the antimatter chamber. (Slaps some clerk on his back) How is she running today, Jimmy?"
Jimmy,"Well, actually, sir... Thereâ€™ve been some problems maintaining safe levels of-"
Jones,"(Slaps Jimmy again, causing Jimmy to drop his clipboard right onto a green button, pushing it) Thatâ€™s fate. I donâ€™t understand a half of that these science types say."
Rigby,"Oh, thatâ€™s too bad. Captain hereâ€™s an expert on it."
Jones,Youâ€™re an expert on antimatter?
Mordecai,Uh... Yeah... Uh... But not compared to how much this guy knows. (Points to Rigby)
Rigby,(Frustrated) Uh...
Mordecai,Did you know he wrote a book on it?
Rigby,We wrote a book on it.
Mordecai,"Well, you did the most of the work on it."
Rigby,But your nameâ€™s on the cover.
Mordecai,"Yeah, right next yours."
Rigby,Above mine!
Jones,"Jimmy, knock off that beepinâ€™."
Jimmy,"Yeah, actually, sir, Iâ€™m having trouble with-"
Jones,"Trouble? We-ell, these guys are experts! Can you lend a hand, fellas?"
Rigby,"Sure, we can. Go ahead, Captain."
Mordecai,"(Approaches the control panel) Well, according to the book lieutenant Rigby wrote, you wanna turn that knob there."
Rigby,(Cuts in) But captainâ€™s own research really out-dates mine. So turn that knob over there.
Mordecai,But heâ€™s forgetting the recent discoveries he made. Flip those switches.
Rigby,Discoveries based on his studies... Hit those buttons.
Mordecai,I never said hit those buttons!
Rigby,"Yeah, Jimmy, youâ€™re not doing like Captain Mordecai said! You gotta do it like this! (Bumps over all the buttons)"
Mordecai,"Dude, quit! Youâ€™re gonna break it!"
Rigby,"No, youâ€™re gonna break it!"
Major Williams,Whatâ€™s all this commotion?
Jones,"Major Williams? Sir! (Dusts off Mordecai and Rigby) We were just showing these new transfers around the compound, sir."
Jimmy,Captain Mordecai! Lieutenant Riggs! The antimatter is becoming unstable!
Jones,"Captain Mordecai, Lieutenant Riggs. You can fix it, right?"
Mordecai,Yes. Lieutenant Riggs can totally fix it.
Rigby,Not without captainâ€™s help!
Jones,No time for modesty! (He opens the antimatter chamber door and shoves Mordecai and Rigby in there.)
Mordecai,"Dude, this is all your fault."
Rigby,What? Youâ€™re the one who wonâ€™t admit that you suck at lying.
Mordecai,â€˜Cause I donâ€™t!
Rigby,Why don't you give up and tell â€˜em whatâ€™s going on so they can help us?
Mordecai,"No, you do it."
Rigby,No way!
Mordecai,Arghhh!! Fine.
Jones,Whatâ€™s the holdup?
Mordecai,Look. I have to tell you the truth. (Rigby nods.) I have a condition that makes me forget everything in times of extreme stress. (Rigby's mouth hangs open in shock.) Lieutenant Riggs doesnâ€™t have that condition. Heâ€™s just an idiot.
Rigby,Hey!
Mordecai,We need you tell us what to do.
Jones,"Oh, my... Jimmy, what do we do?"
Jimmy,They have to penetrate the anti-nucleus with something solid!
Jones,Right! Listen up! You have one chance at this thing. You have to throw Lieutenant Riggs into the anti-nucleus.
Rigby,WHAT?!?!
Jones,"Itâ€™s the only way. Captain Mordecai is too big for you to throw. You must sacrifice yourself to save thousands of lives, lieutenant!"
Rigby,"NO!! Donâ€™t listen to him, Mordecai! DONâ€™T DO IT!!!!"
Jones,Do it! Throw him in! THROW HIM IN!!!
Rigby,Please! No! No!
Jones,Throw him now! NOW!!!
Rigby,"Iâ€™m sorry! Iâ€™m sorry for lying! You win, okay? I wonâ€™t lie anymore!"
Mordecai,"Itâ€™s too late, Rigby. I canâ€™t let everybody die because of us. (Mordecai lifts Rigby up over his head and is about to throw him in...)"
Rigby,NO!!!!
Rigby,Huh? (Sees that his jacket is unzipped)
Mordecai,You thought I was gonna throw you in? I told you Iâ€™m a better liar than you. (Holds the grilled cheese bag in his hand)
Rigby,Bensonâ€™s grilled cheese!
Mordecai,You better hope this works. Huh!
Rigby,Nyahh!
Mordecai,Rigby! Ahh!
Rigby,Weâ€™re not astronauts.
Jones,"If you ever lie about being astronauts again, YOUâ€™RE DEAD!!!"
Rigby,"We saved the city, astro-"
Benson,Where have you been? Iâ€™ve been waiting all day.
Benson,What the...? What happened to my sandwich?
Rigby,There were spacemen! At Cheezerâ€™s! And the tube... we went down and... everyone wore sweatpants... even us... and then the room with the bad stuff... but... we saved the city with your sandwich.
Benson,Ugh!... Why do you always have to lie to my face?
Mordecai,We ran it over by accident.
Benson,See? Was it so hard to tell the truth?
Benson,"Alright, listen up. We've got this birthday party today, so...lots to do...lots to do. Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, you're in charge of picking up the special entertainment."
Hi Five Ghost,Yes! Uh!
Benson,"Skips, you set up the bouncy castle."
Skips,Hm.
Benson,"Let's see, I'm picking up the kids, so...Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs."
Rigby,Agh!
Pops,"Oh, what about me? Surely, I'm invited to my own birthday party!"
Benson,"Um, your birthday was last week, remember? It's a kid's party today."
Pops,I still have balloons!
Benson,"We got it covered, Pops!"
Pops,Oh. I see.
Mordecai,"Dude, how come we always get stuck with the lame jobs? Setting up the chairs!?"
Rigby,Lame!
Benson,I can't trust you guys with something actually important. You're always slacking off!
Mordecai,You calling us slackers?
Rigby,Did he? Did you?
Mordecai,"He's calling us slackers. Look dude, we can totally set up all those chairs without slacking off."
Benson,Good. Do it then.
Mordecai,We will.
Rigby,"Yeah, and then next time you'll get someone else to set up the chairs?"
Benson,Fine.
Rigby,OOHHH! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Uh!
Benson,Just set up the chairs.
Rigby,"Benson's gonna drop his balls when he sees how good we set up these chairs! He's gonna be all like ""Oh no, my gumballs!"""
Mordecai,"(laughs) Yeah-yuh, we rule at setting up the chairs! (hands Rigby a chair) One."
Rigby,One!
Rigby,"Yeah, dude. This sucks."
Mordecai,"I agree dude, and normally I'd be all ""let's quit"", but we have to prove to Benson we can set up these chairs."
Rigby,Alright. Gah! Must be nice to be the boss. Benson never has to do chores.
Benson,"Happy birthday, Jiâ€”"
Jimmy,"Just drive the bus, you crazy slop jockey!"
Mordecai,"What the H, dude?"
Rigby,(laughs hysterically)
Mordecai,Can we please just focus?
Rigby,"Ugh, when you say that, it makes me tired."
Mordecai,Dude.
Rigby,"Ugh, you sound like Benson."
Mordecai,"Dude! Listen, if we pound through this, we'll never have to do this lame chair stuff again."
Rigby,"Next time, it could be us picking up -"
Rigby,The special entertainment!
Muscle Man,We are here to pick you up.
Pony,Just a second.
Clown,"Agh, who's at the door?"
Clown,"Whoa, it's bright!"
Muscle Man,You know who likes special entertainment like that? My mom!
Special Entertainment Clown,Can I borrow five bucks?
Mordecai,Thirty-seven...
Mordecai,Thirty eight...
Mordecai,Thirty eight?
Mordecai,Rigby!
Rigby,"That's all the chairs, dude."
Mordecai,There's supposed to be fifty.
Rigby,That's Benson's problem.
Mordecai,"No, dude. That's our problem."
Rigby,Hmm!
Mordecai,"Come on, we gotta find the rest."
Rigby,Fine. Let's find your stupid chairs.
Rigby,"It won't open, let's get out of here."
Mordecai,Did you try the actual doorknob?
Rigby,"Agh, you're killing me!"
Rigby,"It's locked, let's do something else."
Mordecai,"Come on, dude. Take this seriously."
Mordecai,"Oh, it is locked."
Rigby,"Hmph, hmph."
Mordecai,We gotta get those chairs.
Rigby,Hey!
Rigby,Whoa!
Mordecai,"Ugh, you see the chairs?"
Rigby,Even better...
Mordecai,What do you me- (gasps)
Rigby,It's like old school heaven!
Mordecai,"Yeah, look at these things!"
Mordecai,"Ball of Yarn, Lemonade Stand, Hats 4 Sale, Clap Like This, Candle Maker, Deli Dude, Staring Contest!? Why are these even here!?"
Rigby,Who cares? Let's play!
Mordecai,"No, dude! Dude, no. You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?"
Rigby,I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?
Mordecai,"Not cool, dude."
Rigby,"Whatever, I'm taking my break."
Mordecai,"Dude, you're not even doing it right. You're just mashing the buttons."
Rigby,"Whatever, why don't you go back to work?"
Mordecai,"I know, how about I take my break too?"
Mordecai,Bam!
Mordecai,OOHHH!!
Rigby,"Man, that was just luck."
Mordecai,"Hmph, hmph."
Mordecai,"OOHHH! Ten in a row! Alright, let's finish those chairs."
Rigby,"Wait, man. What about that one?"
Mordecai,"Didn't they teach you how to read? ""Out of order""."
Rigby,Whoa! This...looks...awesome!
Mordecai,"Yeah. Whatever, it's broken."
Rigby,"Probably 'cause people couldn't stop playing it, 'cause it's so awesome!"
Mordecai,"Pfft, how are you gonna fix that with your third grade education?"
Rigby,Hey! Why don't you go ask Benson to tell you what to do?
Mordecai,"Move over, Rigby."
Rigby,"""In the name of all that is holy, don't connect the red wire to the blue wire""?"
Mordecai,I don't think we should do this.
Rigby,"Come on, come on!"
Mordecai,"Dude, what just happened?"
Rigby,I don't know!
Mordecai,That can't be good.
Rigby,"I don't know, he could be cool."
Mordecai,"Oh man, we're so dead."
Rigby,Maybe no one will notice.
Pops,"Oh, who unleashed the Destroyer of Worlds? Good show!"
Mordecai,We better go find Skips.
Mordecai,"Skips! Uh, dude."
Skips,What did you guys do?
Mordecai,What? Nothing!
Skips,"You ignored my note, didn't you?"
Mordecai,A note? What note?
Rigby,You mean like a musical note?
Skips,You fools! Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!
Skips,"I have an idea, but I need time. Distract it!"
Mordecai,"Wait, what? Distract it how?"
Rigby,Get outta here!
Rigby,Uh oh.
Benson,We're here...
Kids,It's the special entertainment! Yay!
Muscle Man,Hey kids! Get ready for our very special entertainment!
Mordecai,We're screwed.
Skips,Get in!
Skips,"Climb on top, but don't press start until I say."
Pops,"Skips, my good man! I lost my balloons."
Skips,Take the wheel.
Pops,"Oh, it must be my birthday!"
Skips,"Okay everyone, press your start buttons on three. One, two, three!"
Mordecai and Rigby,Whoa!
Skips,"Mordecai and I got the arms, Rigby, you got the legs."
Rigby,"Aw, what!? Legs? Legs suck! Man, this is worse than the chairs!"
Mordecai,"Dude! Quit mashing the buttons, you're messing up the legs!"
Rigby,Shut up!
Skips,"Drive, Pops, drive!"
Pops,This is so much fun! Woohoo!
Mordecai,Skips!
Mordecai,"Pops, stop! We lost Skips!"
Mordecai,Skips!
Mordecai,The extra chairs!
Mordecai,"Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds! I'm gonna go get the chairs!"
Rigby,"It's too dangerous, just leave them!"
Mordecai,I don't care! We're not slackers!
Rigby,(gasps) Mordecai!
Destroyer,What the...?
Mordecai,The button mashing's working! Finish him off dude!
Mordecai,That was some pretty sweet button mashing.
Rigby,I told you I got skills!
Benson,You!
Mordecai,"Whoa! Hey, Benson. Before you freak out, we totally set up those chairs!"
Muscle Man,Woo! This birthday party's hot!
Rigby,"So we're cool, right?"
Benson,"You idiots! That's the last time I entrust you with something important, like the chairs!"
Rigby,OOHHH! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time!
Benson,"But you are gonna clean up this mess, and you can start by sweeping up the special entertainment!"
Mordecai,"Yeah, no problem."
Rigby,We got it.
Mordecai,Don't worry about us.
Rigby,"We're gonna take a break first, right?"
Mordecai,Yeah.
Rigby,"Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!"
Mordecai,What's here?
Rigby,Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,"Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said..."
Mordecai,"Yes, I wanna be in a band with you. Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name. What do you think of ""Cool Dudes""?"
Rigby,"""Face Punch."""
Mordecai,"""Rad 'N' Subtract."""
Rigby,"""Helicopter Crash."""
Mordecai,"What about ""Mustache Cash Stash""?"
Rigby,That's it! That's it!
Mordecai,Order the shirts! Order the shirts!
Mordecai,"Oh yeah, T-Shirts."
Rigby,"Check it out. Bam! (Pulls out a ""Mordecai and the Rigbys"" t-shirt)"
Mordecai,Mordecai and the Rigbys? What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?
Rigby,"I changed it. Awesome, right? (Throws a t-shirt at Mordecai)"
Mordecai,"But that's just our names. We aren't really going to wear these around, are we?"
Margaret,"Woah, rad shirts! What are those for?"
Rigby,They're for our band.
Margaret,"You guys are in a band? ""Mordecai and the Rigbys""? That's so cool."
Mordecai,"No, no, no, we're not in a band, heh..."
Margaret,"(skeptically) So, what, it's some sort of fake band?"
Mordecai,"No, it's a real band, but just... not a big deal, you know?"
Margaret,(gasps) Your band should play the open mic tomorrow night. (Hands Mordecai and Rigby a flyer)
Mordecai,"Yeah, for sure, uh... totally."
Margaret,"Awesome. I can't wait to see you guys play. Well, I guess I'll see you then."
Mordecai,Yeah... see you then... then. (Faceplants on the table)
Rigby,"What was that, man?"
Mordecai,I don't know! I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!
Rigby,But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!
Mordecai,"OK, OK, we can totally do this. We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night."
Rigby,One song?
Mordecai,One song.
Mordecai,Ready?
Rigby,Shreddy.
Mordecai,"One, two, three, four!"
Mordecai,"OK, stop, stop. We need help."
Pops,A two-man ensemble? What a charming idea!
Mordecai,"How'd you learn to be so good, Pops?"
Pops,Ah-ha! (Rises from the harpsichord bench and pulls out some records from inside. The first is 'How to be a Musician' by 'Sir Geoffrey') Throw these records on the old talking machine and you'll be ready for your open mic in no time!
Mordecai,"Agh, you know about the open mic night?"
Pops,"Yes, everybody knows about it. We're all going to be there!"
Mordecai and Rigby,Augh!
Rigby,"Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously."
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,Put on the shirt.
Mordecai,Fine. (Puts on his Mordecai and the Rigbys t-shirt) Play the record.
Sir Geoffrey,"So, you want to become a musician? Bravo! Now, what is the first thing all good musicians require?"
Mordecai,Talent?
Sir Geoffrey,Yes! Good personal hygiene is the key to becoming a successful gentleman musician!
Mordecai,"(Talks over the record) Augh, this is gonna take like ten years!"
Rigby,"Yeah, and there's still two more after this one! (Holds up the remaining two records)"
Mordecai,There's gotta be a faster way.
Sir Geoffrey,... all washed up? Good! Now just locate your...
Rigby,All three at once?
Sir Geoffrey,"(from three speakers)... one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped..."
Rigby,"Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything!"
Mordecai,"Dude, we gotta keep going. Do you wanna look like an idiot at the open mic?"
Mordecai,What was that?
Mordecai,"Dude, what's happening?!"
Rigby,I don't know!
Mordecai and Rigby,Woah!
Mordecai and Rigby,Woooaaah...
Mordecai,"Dude, who are you guys?"
Future Mordecai,(in British accent) We're Mordecai and Rigby. Who the blazes are you?
Mordecai,Uhh...
Future Mordecai,Hah! Just kiddin'. We know who you are. Coz we're you in ten years!
Future Rigby,"(in British accent) You don't know it yet, but this is the moment where we teach you how to rock! (Makes metal sign with right hand)"
Mordecai,"Dude, this is perfect!"
Rigby,"Wait, wait. We suck, and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?"
Future Mordecai,Didn't you just hear us play?
Future Rigby,"Yeah, we're super-successful musicians in the future."
Mordecai,"Yeah, look at us, dude! We're wearing sunglasses!"
Future Mordecai,"Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades."
Rigby,"Awesome! Oh, hey, in the future, do we get that thing we always wanted?"
Future Rigby,"Oh, we got it. (Pulls up shirt to reveal a biting shark tattoo on his armpit, which bites when he moves his arm)"
Rigby,Awesome!
Mordecai,"Oh, hey, in the future, do I get to go out with Margaret?"
Future Mordecai,Huh! (Suggestively) I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.
Mordecai,Aww.
Future Mordecai,Look. We promise we'll get you ready for tomorrow night's gig if you're willing to put in the work.
Mordecai,"Yeah, whatever it takes."
Future Rigby,We said the same thing ten years ago.
Mordecai and Rigby,Awesome!
Future Mordecai,Let's rock!
Future Mordecai,That's it. You're ready!
Mordecai and Rigby,What?
Mordecai,But we never learned how to play!
Rigby,We haven't even picked up a guitar.
Mordecai,"Come on, we got the look, we've got the moves down, I know the lyrics backwards and forwards. Just teach us how to play!"
Future Mordecai,"Woah, woah, woah! Don't worry. You know enough. You're gonna be fine. Besides, it's too late to teach you anything else. Gig's in 20 minutes."
Mordecai,We're screwed.
Angel,"(sings) ... You're my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you..."
Benson,I can't believe they're gonna play tonight. Those two slackers have never even picked up an instrument. This is gonna be a trainwreck.
Pops,"Woo, I love trains!"
Angel,"(sings) ... my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you. (song ends to wild applause. Mordecai and Rigby watch from behind a curtain)"
Rigby,Dang!
Mordecai,"Yeah. (Mordecai walks backstage, holding his stomach and groaning. Rigby picks up a box)"
Rigby,Should I hand out the last of the t-shirts?
Mordecai,You brought the t-shirts?
Rigby,"Yeah, for the fans."
Mordecai,"Dude, we don't even have any fans. (Grabs the box of t-shirts)"
Margaret,"Oh, wow! You guys look like rock stars. Hey, can I have one of those?"
Mordecai,"Uh, yeah... (chuckles nervously) Here's a small."
Margaret,How do I look?
Mordecai,(pause) Amazing.
Margaret,I can hand these out for you guys. Get everyone pumped for the closing act.
Mordecai and Rigby,Closing act?
Margaret,"Yeah, save the best for last. Well, break a leg, guys. I can't wait."
Announcer,"(from through the curtain) And finally, give it up for Mordecai and the Rigbys! Yeah, come on!"
Future Mordecai,Sorry we're late.
Mordecai,Where've you guys been?
Future Mordecai,We had to get you these. (holds up glowing guitar picks with a lightning motif)
Mordecai,Picks?! But we still don't even know how to play!
Future Mordecai,"Just go out there, you'll be great. Just like we were ten years ago."
Mordecai,But...
Future Mordecai,(shoving Mordecai and Rigby through the curtain) Crowd's waitin'! Go on!
Mordecai,Uhh...
Muscle Man,"Come on, ladies, play us a tasty lick!"
Benson,Holy crap!
Mordecai,"Your eyes starin' into my eyes, who am I but a guy with two eyes on the prize, and the prize in my eyes is ten times the surprise in your eyes as I kiss you goodnight. / The smile is the fire that lights my soul, gonna remember it until I grow old, cause life's too short, we've gotta do things right, so baby let's just party toni-ight. / Baby, let's just party toni-ight."
Mordecai,(yelling) Rigby!
Mordecai,"No! Augh! (Mordecai sees a CD player at the side of the stage. Future Mordecai and Rigby wave and play air-guitar. Mordecai rushes over and turns off the CD, and the crowd falls silent but for a few calls of ""What?"")"
Rigby,"(still playing the unplugged electric guitar, badly) Uhuh! Yeah! Yeah, baby!"
Mordecai,You can stop now.
Mordecai,"Wait, wait. I can explain, I can explain! We were lip-synching."
Mordecai,"Hey, look, I don't blame you. We thought we could just order some t-shirts and pass ourselves off as a band. But it turns out, playing music's really hard to do. We just got caught up in the dream, man. And just for a little while, it was real. But that's over. And lip-synching's not cool. So we're breaking up the band."
Future Mordecai,(runs onto the stage with Future Rigby) Why'd you stop? It was going great.
Mordecai,You tricked us into lip-synching!
Future Mordecai,Look. We've become rich and famous because of lip-synching. Don't you wanna be a part of that?
Mordecai,"(angry) No, that's lame! You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be."
Rigby,Me neither!
Mordecai,Mordecai and the Rigbys is over. (The two take off their t-shirts. Future Mordecai and Future Rigby begin to fade from view)
Future Mordecai and Future Rigby,"Woah, woah!"
Future Mordecai,"OK, dude. Think about what you're doing."
Future Rigby,"Yeah, stop, man!"
Future Mordecai,"If you break up the band, what are we gonna do in the future?"
Mordecai,I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise. (Mordecai starts to rip his t-shirt)
Future Mordecai and Future Rigby,Nooo!
Benson,Yeah-heah! Alright!
Rigby,I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing. This is awesome!
Margaret,(waving through the crowd) Mordecai! Mordecai!
Mordecai,(waving back and fighting through) Margaret! Margaret! Margaret!
Margaret,Mordecai!
Mordecai,Margaret!
Margaret,"That was pretty cool, what you said up there."
Mordecai,"Thanks, Margaret."
Margaret,"Oh, hey, have you met my new boyfriend, Angel?"
Angel,"C'mon, baby. We don't wanna be late for our (sings) dinner reserva-ations."
Margaret,"Oh, yeah. See you, guys! Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice."
Rigby,(pause) Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.
Old Woman,Hello.
Master Prank Caller,"Oh, yes, this is I'm a sure."
Old Woman,"I'm a sure, who?"
Master Prank Caller,"I'm a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama! (Mordecai & Rigby both laugh at the prank call video) Oh, yeah! You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!"
Rigby,"The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet, right, Mordecai?"
Mordecai,"Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny. But you know what's even funnier than watching prank phone calls?"
Rigby,"Hmm, hmm, hmm!"
Pops,Hello?
Rigby,"[On the phone, off-screen] Hello, Pops?"
Pops,Yes?
Rigby,"[On the phone, off-screen] Please hold for a collect call from... JOE MAMA!!!"
Skips,Hello?
Rigby,"Hey, Skips, do you have a son named ""Joe Mama""?"
Skips,Excuse me?
Benson,Hello?
Mordecai,"Hey, Benson, you got any books by ""Joe Mama""?"
Benson,Who is this?! (Mordecai and Rigby laugh even harder than before. Mordecai lets go of the phone with Benson still talking)
Benson,"[On the phone, off-screen] WHEREVER THIS IS COMING FROM, I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN AND I WILL FIND YOU, AND IF IT...!!!"
Mordecai,"Oh, dude, he's still on the phone!"
Rigby,HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE?!?!?!
Mordecai,"HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE! H, HA, HA, HA!!!"
Rigby,"O-O-O-h! Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?"
Mordecai,"Yeah, second best."
Rigby,What? Uh. Did you not hear what we just did? We were hilarious!
Mordecai,"Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this."
Rigby,Who are you calling? (Mordecai stops shifting through pages and points to a number on the book)
Mordecai,The Master Prank Caller.
Rigby,Holy crap.
Benson,"[off-screen] HANG UP THAT PHONE! [on-screen] You think your little pranks are funny? Huh?! You think they're funny?! Well, what do you guys think of my prank? (walking towards the phone, he pretends to think he's being called by someone) Ring, ring. Hello, what's that? Mordecai and Rigby are banned from using the house phone? Okay. GRRRRGHHHH!!!!!! (Suddenly, Benson's face turns red. He pulls the phone from the wall and smashes it to pieces on the floor) GRRGHH!!!! GUGHHH!!!! GAAGGHHHHH!!!!!"
Benson,GOOD LUCK MAKING YOUR PRANK CALLS NOW!!!!!!!!
Mordecai,"Dude, let's go use Pops' phone."
Mordecai and Rigby,"Pops, can we borrow your phone?"
Pops,"Oh, I would, but I'm holding to talk with Joe Mama. (A pulse tone is heard from the phone) But you're welcome to use the phones under my bed."
Mordecai,"Aw, cool! What kind are they? (Rigby pulls a case from under Pops' bed and opens it to find 80s brick-sized phones.)"
Rigby,"Aw, '80s cellphones!"
Rigby,"Cool. Thanks, Pops."
Pops,"Oh, and boys... do be careful. I think they might cause brain tumors. (Dramatic music plays as Pops turns back to the phone and then his head starts to throb. Mordecai and Rigby exchange knowing glances.)"
Rigby,Alright. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.
Mordecai,"Okay, here I go. (Mordecai dials the phone and the telephone rings. The Master Prank Caller picks up to answer.)"
Master Prank Caller,Hello?
Mordecai,"Yeah, this is, uh, pizza delivery guy? I have 50 pizzas here that you ordered. (Mordecai and Rigby snicker)"
Master Prank Caller,Sounds great. Bring 'em over.
Mordecai,"Uh, you ordered 50 pizzas?"
Master Prank Caller,"Yeah, and hot wings. Get here quick, okay? Your mom's like totally starving."
Mordecai,"Yeah, uh, okay. I gotta go. (Mordecai hangs up the phone)"
Rigby,Let me take a crack at it. (Rigby dials and the telephone rings again)
Master Prank Caller,Hello?
Rigby,"(Idiotic voice) Hi, this is Stan."
Master Prank Caller,Stan who?
Rigby,Uh... Stan... (Normal voice) Stanminson.
Master Prank Caller,Your name is Stan Stanminson?
Rigby,Uh... yep.
Master Prank Caller,"Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard. And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?"
Rigby,I don't know.
Master Prank Caller,"Now listen up, stop calling here or I'm gonna make you sorry! (MPC hangs up phone)"
Mordecai,"Whoa, this guy's good. I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this."
Rigby,"What, you givin' up? Dude, we can prank this guy. Do you want to be this guy's son, or do you want to be number one?"
Mordecai,"Hmm, hmm, let's do it. (Mordecai dials the phone) Hello, Master Prank Caller, this is..."
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] Did it. (MPC hangs up)
Rigby,Hmm.
Rigby,"Yeah, buddy, it's Joe Ma...!"
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] Heard it. (MPC hangs up)
Mordecai,"Yeah, hello?"
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] You got anything original? (MPC hangs up)
Rigby,"""Yeah, hello?"" Dude, that was the worst try yet."
Rigby,Time to put an end to this junk fest. Hmm.
Mordecai,Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.
Rigby,"Yeah, right, like your ""50 pizzas"" thing was way better."
Mordecai,"Whatever Stan Manastan, man. (Laughs)"
Mordecai,"Pff, nice try, dude. I know it's you."
Rigby,"Uh... not me, dude."
Mordecai,Hello?
Master Prank Caller,Is this the pizza guy or Stan Stanminson?
Mordecai,Uh... both?
Master Prank Caller,"[on-screen] I warned you to leave me alone. Now I'm gonna prank you so hard, you're both gonna poop a duke. [off-screen] The 1980's called: they want their cell phones back!"
Mordecai and Rigby,AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rigby,Where are we?
Mordecai,"Dude, I think we're back at the park."
Rigby,Are we?
Mordecai,What do you mean?
Rigby,"(eyeing the spots) Dude, all the trees are small, and look at that park bench, it's so new looking. I'm telling you, something weird's going on."
Mordecai,"Look, there's Pops. Let's go ask him. (Pops is facing away from the duo, working on planting a tree) Pops! Hey, Pops, can you tell Rigby here that everything is fine?"
Pops,What now?
Mordecai,Why does Pops look so young?
Pops,"Now then, who are you two gentlemen? How do you know my name?"
Mordecai,"Pops, It's us, Mordecai and Rigby."
Pops,But I've never met either of you gentlemen in my entire life.
Mordecai,What?
Rigby,"I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on."
Rigby,"Hey, guys!"
Rigby,You notice anything strange going on around here?
Rigby,"Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries? We're in the '80s, dude! Pops, what year is this?"
Pops,"Well, it's 1982, of course."
Rigby,See?
Mordecai,"Dude, this is bad."
Rigby,"I know, I don't even like the '80s that much!"
Mordecai,The only way we're gonna get back is that we prank him harder than he pranked us.
Rigby,Let's do it.
Master Prank Caller,Hello?
Mordecai,"The '60s called, they want..."
Master Prank Caller,"[off-screen] What did I tell you about calling me?! (A yellow, sparkling cloud begins to shoot out of the top of the phone, shocking Mordecai and Rigby)"
Rigby,Hang up! Hang up!
Mordecai,I can't! (Mordecai drops the phone)
Master Prank Caller,You couldn't leave me alone. Now you're gonna pay! (MPC dials on himself)
Mordecai,We should get out of here.
Rigby,The cart!
Rigby,Hello?
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] The '80s called. They still want ya!
Mordecai,"Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the '80s!"
Rigby,"Listen, just leave us alone, will you?!"
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] Don't you ever hang up on me!
Mordecai,"Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!"
Rigby,Who?!
Mordecai,Just call somebody!
Pops,"Ooh, telephone. Hello?"
Rigby,"Pops, you gotta help us; we're stuck in the '80s!"
Benson,Who are you talking to?
Pops,Why it's Mordecai and Rigby. They're stuck in the 1980's.
Benson,"Oh, really?"
Benson,Hello?
Mordecai,"Benson, you have got to help us! We're stuck in 1982!"
Benson,"Oh, wow. That's really something, Mordecai."
Mordecai,Crap! He thinks we're pranking him!
Rigby,What? Give me that!
Rigby,"The '80s [off-screen] called, they want their cell phones back!"
Benson,What happened?
Mordecai,We need your help to prank the Master Prank Caller.
Benson,Who?
Skips,Why did you prank him?
Benson,I'll take care of this. Hello?
Master Prank Caller,"Nice ride, but I like mine better."
Master Prank Caller,Blargh!
Skips,"Forget the phone, hold the wheel steady."
Mordecai,"Don't answer it, don't answer!"
Skips,"Mordecai, look out!"
Rigby,"Dude, we just hit past Pops!"
Clerk,"Uh, can I help you with anything?"
Mordecai,"Dude, I got an idea."
Mordecai,"Quick, get to the field! Everybody hide! (The answering machine trap is deployed) Over there!"
Mordecai,"Man, I hope this works."
Rigby,"It will, Mordecai. It has to."
Voice of Mordecai,Hello?
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] This is The Master Prank Caller telling you--
Voice of Mordecai,Hello?
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank--
Voice of Mordecai,"Hello? uh.. I'm sorry, I can't hear you."
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank Caller!
Voice of Mordecai,"Hello, hello, are you there?"
Master Prank Caller,[off-screen] RRRRGH! (The Master Prank Caller appears next to the phone and tape recorder) I SAID-- (Realizes that the voice is coming from a recorder - he's been psyched)
Voice of Mordecai,"Ha ha! Just kidding. You just got pranked, loser! (Recording stops)"
Master Prank Caller,NOOOOOOOOO!!!
Mordecai,"Now! (Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Pops and Benson jump out of the bushes and make a dog pile on the Master Prank Caller, holding him down)"
Mordecai,"Now, Rigby, hit the power button!"
Rigby,"Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?! (Rigby climbs up the phone and hits the power button)"
Master Prank Caller,"No! No! NOOOOOOO- (Shut down, the MPC falls to the ground and makes no movement Mordecai and Rigby laugh)"
Mordecai and Rigby,"In your face! Who's the master prank caller now, you loser?"
Mordecai,"Guys, this is it; it's the way back! Come on!"
Mordecai,One of these doors leads us back to the present.
Benson,There it is.
Master Prank Caller,"Wait. (MPC's speaker breaks, revealing his true identity - a thin, undead-looking man) You guys were better than me today, but you can't leave me here. All I ever wanted to do was make prank calls like you. Was that so wrong? (The Master Prank Caller splutters and moans. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)"
Benson,Hello?
Rigby and the Master Prank Caller,"(To each other off-screen) 1, 2, 3. (Into the phone off-screen) The '70s called: they want their chair back!"
