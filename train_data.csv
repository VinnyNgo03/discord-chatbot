"(laughs) Yeah, yeah!",Yes! Fist Pump!
(laughs),"(laughs) Yeah, yeah!"
We have to go to that concert!,(laughs) There's gonna be so many losers at that concert.
"Correction, they're cool in any grade, but you wouldn't know that. Probably because you hate yourself or something!","Seriously? Dude, they were cool in the third grade, but now...?"
"Doesn't even matter! We can figure out a way, but you're too busy figuring out a way to hate yourself!","Dude, we don't have the money for those tickets."
Going to this concert could be the biggest moment of my life...,Why do you wanna go so bad?
Shut up!,"Wow, sounds like your life sucks."
We were talking about a concert. Is the concert you're talking about Fist Pump?,Were you guys talking about the concert?
"Oh, so now you're gonn-",I'm totally gonna go.
I can't believe you're going to a Fist Pump concert just for some lady pecs.,"Yeah, see ya."
"Whatever, it's to listen to music, I already know that. Now, how are we going to get the money for those tickets?","Rigby, one day you'll be old enough to understand the real reason that people go to concerts."
Extra work? I don't even like regular work.,"Dude, it's gonna be easy. We just have to work some extra hours."
Yes.,Do you like Fist Pump?
"Hmph, fine.","Hmph, then you like extra work."
"Hmph, hmph.","Hmph, hmph."
"Hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph...","Hmph, hmph."
"Aw, come on, Benson, please! Fist Pump is playing at Slammers and we don't have enough money for tickets!",(laughs) No.
"Benson, you listen and you listen good.","Woo! That's right, ladies! We got two tickets to Fist Pump! See you later, grandmas!"
Please Benson! Please give us overtime! Please!,"Benson, you listen and you listen good."
OOHHHH!!!,(sighs) Fine. You can work overtime.
OOOHHHH!!!,"Here's a list of things we need done, when you finish them, you'll get your money."
"Dude, I'm fading fast.","Mordecai and Rigby clean the gutters, with Rigby on the roof grabbing the dirt and throwing it down to Mordecai on the ground, holding a bucket. They then clean the cart, with Rigby wiping the front of the cart and Mordecai wiping the back, while holding a hose. They then take out the trash, with Mordecai throwing a trash bag to Rigby, who dumps it into a dumpster. They both start fist-pumping and Mordecai crosses ""Trash"" off the chore list. They then clean the bathroom, with Rigby unclogging the toilet and Mordecai wiping down the sink. They then wash the dishes, with Mordecai pulling dishes out of the sink and passing them to Rigby to dry them off. They start fist-pumping again, and Mordecai crosses ""Dishes"" off the chore list. The montage is then interrupted as Rigby switches off a boombox. He and Mordecai look exhausted)"
What?,$400.
"No, no, no!","Aw, man!"
"Mordecai, wait! Wait, man. We can't give up. Fist Pump!","No, no, no!"
"Yeah, give us more money.","Benson, we need more money."
The lawn!?,There's no more chores left. Unless...you want to mow the lawn?
Ohhhhhh...,"Hmph, hmph. Who needs luck when we have coffee?"
"Dude, seriously though, my eyes won't stay open anymore, and I think we're almost out of coffee.",Ohhhhhh...
"Mordecai, what happened?","Nonsense, dude. We got plenty of coffee."
Fist Pump...,Need more coffee...need more Margaret...
"Ah, cool, a contract! Let's sign it!","Coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee, coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee."
So cool...,"Aw, man, I didn't know deluxe tickets were coated in diamonds."
"Oh, jeez!",Where are the other two tickets?
"There's no 'other tickets', man. We only had enough for two.","Oh, jeez!"
Woo!!! Fist Pump!!!!,But we had a contract!
"Dude, check it. Bang bang! Dude, I've got two if you want to take one to the concert.","Coffee, coffee, coffee!"
Thanks!,"Mordecai and Rigby, we are very excited for you to be the ones to see Fist Pump. Please accept this coffee to help you make it through concert."
Fist Pump!,"Rigby, come on, they got the tickets! Come on, let's go, let's go!"
Now what are we supposed to do?,Fist Pump!
Shut it!,But we had a contract!
Everybody hates you.,"You know, at first I thought you were cool. But now, I know that you're both total losers."
"Dude, there they are!","Hey, dude."
We did it! Fist Pump! Fist Pump!,"Dude, there they are!"
"Aw, don't worry about her, you'll get another chance.","Oh, this sucks."
(laughs) Woo!!,"Aw, don't worry about her, you'll get another chance."
"Dude, wake up! They're about to come out!",(laughs) Woo!!
Wait. Must...stay awake. Must...see best band of all... time!,"Dude, wake up! They're about to come out!"
"Aw, crap.",Wait. Must...stay awake. Must...see best band of all... time!
What's that supposed to mean?,"Augh, this sucks."
I think it's the funniest job at the park.,"It means that the next time we get to pick our job for the day, I get to pick. Why did you pick the Snack Bar?! This is like the worst job at the park, dude!"
Why would I admit something that I'm not?,You don't really think that. You just don't want to admit that you're wrong.
Is it more boring than your face?,"Dude, seriously, this is more boring than watching you trying to read a children's book."
"Is it more boring than my fist in your face, You turd!",I don't know. Is it more boring than my fist in your face?
"No, you're a turd!",You're a turd!
(Starts fighting) You're the turd!,"No, you're a turd!"
"(Start dusting themselves off) Oh, hey, Pops.","Mordecai, Rigby, stop! We can all be turds."
It's awesome.,"So, how do you like being the guardians of the snacks?"
I guess this means I was right about the Snack Bar.,"When I work here, all the snacks are free! Ta ta. (Walks away)"
"What? Are you kidding? Dude, all these snacks are free, dude. (Stops himself from vomiting) Trust me. If we keep eating, we'll feel better in no time.","I need to eat something healthy, like a salad or something."
"Loser?! I don't know that I want to listen to the guy who was wrong about the Snack Bar being cool. No, I think I'd rather listen to the guy who's right all the time. ME. (Holds up a fried soda cup and takes a bite out of it)","Oh, if we eat more, we'll feel better? Dude, quit being a loser."
Hmm. Hmm. (Grimaces in pain as his stomach rumbles),Augh! Sick!
"(Who is next to a blender with a doughnut, candy, and other junk food inside) So do I. (He starts the blender, grinding all the junk food into goop. He then proceeds to drink it, grimacing in pain again as his stomach rumbles.)",(Takes a bite of the salad) Ahh. I feel so much better.
Stop talking!,"Dude, I'm telling you. If you keep eating like that, your body's gonna quit on you."
"Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. I showed him. (Puts another doughnut in his mouth. A split second later, Rigby is rolling on the floor, groaning in pain) Why isn't more food working...? (Screams in pain, then picks up the doughnut next to him) One more should do it... (He suddenly drops the doughnut as he loses control of his hands) Huh? (Rigby's hands grab his face, pull him to his feet, and drag him around the room. He smashes into a wall, then falls over the fallen chair. His hands then pull really hard, causing his eyes to roll back into his head and glow) What are you doing?! (His hands keep pulling, eventually ejecting Rigby as a green glob of consciousness with Rigby's eyes.)",Whatever. I'm just trying to help. (Walks out of the kitchen)
"Aww, let me back in! (His body pushes him away and runs off) Wait! Come back! (Tries to follow his body, but ends up inside a bucket on the floor) Ohhh... Whatever. I'm just gonna chill in this bucket.","Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. I showed him. (Puts another doughnut in his mouth. A split second later, Rigby is rolling on the floor, groaning in pain) Why isn't more food working...? (Screams in pain, then picks up the doughnut next to him) One more should do it... (He suddenly drops the doughnut as he loses control of his hands) Huh? (Rigby's hands grab his face, pull him to his feet, and drag him around the room. He smashes into a wall, then falls over the fallen chair. His hands then pull really hard, causing his eyes to roll back into his head and glow) What are you doing?! (His hands keep pulling, eventually ejecting Rigby as a green glob of consciousness with Rigby's eyes.)"
(Calling from the bucket) Mordecai! Mordecai!,"Aww, let me back in! (His body pushes him away and runs off) Wait! Come back! (Tries to follow his body, but ends up inside a bucket on the floor) Ohhh... Whatever. I'm just gonna chill in this bucket."
"Ha ha! Who's the loser now, Mordecai?","(Sees Rigby as the green glob) Aww, SICK! What the heck is that?!"
"Dude, in your face! I was right! My stomach doesn't even hurt anymore.",Wait... Rigby?
"Yeah, bad like good! Now shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole!","That's because you don't even have a BODY anymore! Dude, this is bad."
"It's cool, I don't mind.","Well, it looks like it's not that big of a deal, if he doesn't mind being a bodiless consciousness for the rest of his life."
Since when does being right make you a--,"What?! No! Dude, quit being a loser."
What? Where ya goin'? At least shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole. Guys? Guys?,"(Walking out the door with Skips) We'll be right back, Rigby. Just stay here."
"(Moving the bucket with all his might, although bodiless; grunting) Ergghh!! Phew! I guess it is kinda harder to move around without my body. (Rigby then sees the hockey stick and roller skates, then comes up with an idea to move around easier)",What? Where ya goin'? At least shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole. Guys? Guys?
"(Loudly) Hey, guys! What's up?",One....two....
"Oh, don't worry about that! Remember how I said I don't need it? Well, I was right again! Dude, check it! (Wheels around as Mordecai watches in horror) It's a trash can and a roller blade.","Ugh! Rigby, you scared it away!"
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. All this being right is making me hungry.,"I can't believe you! Please, just stay put! (Walks away)"
(Slams the Snack Bar door open) Gimme some snacks!,"This, Sucks! Wait, what is that? (Sees Rigby in the bucket, skating to the Snack Bar)"
"It's me, Rigby!",Looks like a bucket of diarrhea.
"No, I didn't steal anything.","(Terrified) Oh, man! That boot with wheels stole Rigby's voice!"
Come back!,"You're not stealing these voices. C'mon Fives, let's bail! (They climb out of the Snack Bar and run off)"
"It's me, Rigby! (Trips on a rock) Aw, man.","No way, bro!"
Help!,(Gasps) Rigby!
Who's there?,No-one can hear you.
N-no. I ate too much junk food.,"Don't worry: just another bodiless consciousness. (Admires Rigby and rolls around him, talking) Woah! Hey, did you work out way too hard, too?"
"Yeah, well, my body's still good.","Yep, that'll do it. Me? I was a bodybuilder. (We see a flashback of a huge, muscular man lifting weights at a gym) I could have gone pro. My friend kept telling me, (a pink blob morphs out of the basketball and starts speaking in angry, mocking tones) ""If you keep pumpin' iron like that, your body's gonna quit on you!"" I told him he was full of it! (Morphs back into the basketball) But I didn't get my bod' back in time and now look at me: stuck with a basketball for a body."
I...,"Wait, your body's still good? Well, whatcha doin' in here, dummy?"
No!,You must not want it. Mind if I take it?
"(Anguished) No!!! (Falls over, crying, but looks over to see the trash door open and Mordecai appear) Mordecai! You were right and I was wrong! (Still crying) I'm sorry for being such a loser. (Pitifully whining in a high voice) Please help me get my body back...!","Don't worry, I'll find it. So long, sucka!"
"But seriously, dude, I want my old body back.",Ohhhhh!!!
Hey! What are you doin' with my body?!,"Body, you're worthless! (Slaps the body) I can't believe you can't do a simple clean and jerk!"
"No, not pretty cool. You dress me like a loser!","Oh, it's you! (Morphs back into Rigby's body) What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?"
Augh! Gimme back my body!,"(Flexes grossly) Aw, you don't like weightlifting singlets? No wonder your body left you. Oh well. Now it's not you anymore... (Flexes again) It's me."
I'll take it from here!,"Pops, slide over."
Give me my body back!,It's too steep. We'll have to go around.
Get outta my body!,No! Get off me!
"Dude, we did it! I got my body back!","Aw, man, my mouth was open!"
I'll never treat you like that again.,(Moans in disgust) Are you sure you still want it?
(Screaming),Dude. How do you feel?
"Well Mordecai, I guess you were right about the Snack Bar being lame. Especially now that we're not into eating all the free snacks.",(Screaming)
What?,"Oh, about that. Those snacks weren't free."
(Pitiful whine) Pops?,Turns out only Pops gets snacks for free.
Ohhh... turds.,Yeah. And I guess we're supposed to work here for the next six months just to pay for it all.
"Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take back what you said about my mom!",Ohhh... turds.
I'll kill you!,"Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take back what you said about my mom!"
What?,Tag up! Tag up!
"Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?",What?
I think he wants me to put the hurt on him.,"Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you?"
You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?,I think he wants you to put the hurt on him.
Yeah-yuh! Did you see how awesome it was when I hit the trampoline?,"Yes, I do!"
But it was fun.,"I can't believe I listened to you! I knew I should've gone out to do some work, but no, ""Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!"""
You mean you're gonna get fired for this.,"Well, yeah, but now there's a big hole in the wall! Dude, we're 23 years old, we shouldn't be busting holes in walls. We're gonna get fired for this!"
"You're the one who threw me too hard, you hole!",What?
"Okay, okay...let's not blame anyone. Now, how in the H are we gonna fix this S?","Don't call me a hole! You're the hole, you're the one who wanted to wrestle!"
"No. Besides, I don't even know how much it'd cost to fix a hole like this. Probably a ton.","I don't know man. (scoffs) We can't fix it, and we definitely can't pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money! Unless you have some money."
"Dude... you are a genius! Of course, raises!",Exactly. Which leaves us with only one possible solution: We convince Benson to give us raises so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.
"Let me stop you there, because I already know what you're going to say...hamboning.","Okay, dude, here'sâ€”"
"Yeah, dude, hamboning! We just go up to Benson and we'll be all like, ""We both want raises!""",What?
"No, no, no, that's not gonna work! What are you, 65?",We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all theâ€”
"Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?","No, no, no, that's not gonna work! What are you, 65?"
"Come on! I'm telling you, dude. Hamboning...","Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?"
"Hamboning will save your life some day. It'll be all like, ""What? You trying to mug me?""",No...
Fine... (gasps) I know what to do!,"No! We're not doing that, okay? Okay?"
(snickers) Are you ready for raises?,Fine... (gasps) I know what to do!
Boop-bweep-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boooo!,(snickers) Are you ready for raises?
I have my methods.,"Whoa-ho-ho-ho, how did you get that?"
(snickers),I have my methods.
"Aw, come on, man! Look!","I don't know, dude. How's that gonna get us raises?"
Just come check it out.,"Aw, come on, man! Look!"
"Actually, I thought you could do the honors.",This is the answer to all our problems. Have you named her yet?
Mm-hmm.,Really?
The Power?,"You know, I've always wanted to date a girl named ""The Power""."
I like it.,Mm-hmm.
Cool...,I like it.
"Yeah, yeah! Ready?","Alright, this time with feeling."
Okay.,"Yeah, yeah."
"Five, six, seven, eight!",Okay.
"Give us a raise, loser!","Five, six, seven, eight!"
"Hey, it's Pops.","Give us a raise, loser!"
"Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.",Is that the sound of music I hear? (laughs)
"Exactly, at least we can test it out on him, and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work.","I don't know, Pops is kinda weird."
Why not?,"Okay, but let's not call him a loser."
"Okay, let's do it.","He's sensitive. I don't want him to cry, I just want him to give us a raise."
Hey Pops! Check it.,"Okay, let's do it."
"Five, six, seven, eight!",Hey Pops! Check it.
"Give us a raise, Pops!","Five, six, seven, eight!"
"Yeah, I know.","Dude, I think that just worked."
Totally.,"I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird, he might have given us actual money."
"Hey, Benson!",Ugh...
"Five, six, seven, eight!","Hey, Benson!"
"Give us a raise, loser!",What are you doing?
Do you realize what this means?,Keep up the good work.
"No, we can do everything we ever wanted!",We can fix the hole?
What? The flying or the hole?,You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did.
"Dude, get to The Power, he knows.",What hole?
"Five, six, seven, eight!","Dude, kick it to max power."
Using The Power in your face!,"Five, six, seven, eight!"
Sending you back to your place!,Using The Power in your face!
Don't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches!,Sending you back to your place!
"Boop-boop bweep, boo-boo-boo, boo-bweep-bee-boo, bee-bee-beep, bee-bee-beep, synchronized!",Don't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches!
"Go away, Skips, it's time for you to go away!","Boop-boop bweep, boo-boo-boo, boo-bweep-bee-boo, bee-bee-beep, bee-bee-beep, synchronized!"
"Yeah, Skips, it's time for you to go to the moon",It's time for you to go to your room!
Uh...,(gasps) Where'd he go?
Isn't that what you said?,Did you just send Skips to the moon?
But it doesn't work that way.,"No, room! I sent him to his room, not the moon, you idiot! Dude, wish him back."
"I can't see him, can I?",What do you mean?
But he's going to be pissed!,"Ugh, then we have to go get him."
"Come on, let's go! Sheesh, you take forever.","Ugh! Look, we'll show you."
Take us to the Moon! Take us to the Moon! Whoa! Won't you take us to the Moon?,"Don't worry, we got it."
"Um, don't get mad at me guys, but, uh - I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon while you guys were in the house.",What is all this junk?
"A bunch of baby ducks, send 'em to the moon. Soda machine that doesn't work, send 'em to the moon!","Um, don't get mad at me guys, but, uh - I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon while you guys were in the house."
"Okay, okay!","Rigby, you guys go get Skips! We'll pick you up!"
"Let's go, let's go!","Pops, help me with this!"
"Gimme a break, I have to come up with the words, you know!",Come on!
"Okay, I got it.","Gimme a break, I have to come up with the words, you know!"
"G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!","Okay, I got it."
"Dude, I think the batteries just died.",What?
The batteries are dead!,Hurry up dude!
"Hamboning will save your life some day. It'll be all like, ""What? You trying to mug me?"" I'm telling you, dude! Hamboning!",What!?
I know what to do.,"Hamboning will save your life some day. It'll be all like, ""What? You trying to mug me?"" I'm telling you, dude! Hamboning!"
Hold this.,I know what to do.
No!!,Hold this.
Woo! Hamboning!,No!!
The batteries are dead!,Use your keyboard!
(laughs) We did it! Yeah!,"Take us home, take us home, take us all back home!"
"Hey, that's mine!",(laughs) We did it! Yeah!
Aww...,Right.
What?,And let's have it...
"Aw, dude, this sucks. The hole's still there. Do you think Benson noticed it?",No.
"Dude, you're a genius!",He won't now!
"(Takes a big sip from his coffee) Ah! Nothing beats drinkin' joe with my bro! Haha, right, Mordecai?","Here're you guys, enjoy."
No she didn't.,"Huh, what? Yeeeeeaaahh. (Sighs) (Margaret then looks at Mordecai) Dude, Margaret totally just smiled at me."
Then why don't you ask her out?,Yes she did.
"Yeah, I wouldn't understand. Probably 'cos I'm too busy drinking joe with my bro like we came here to do in the first place, remember?",Agh. It's not that easy. You wouldn't understand.
"Pssh. What kind of loser would want a bunch of chicks tearing their clothes off? Right, Mordecai?","I once was lost, but now I'm found. (Sprays cologne, and women tears the man's clothes off) DudeTime, for men."
Mordecai? Mordecai?,"Gee Mordecai, I don't think I've ever realized how awesome you are. And you smell great too. Mordecai? Mordecai?"
Agh! Why? You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.,"Dude, I'm buying that cologne."
(Sings the theme song from the commercial) Bam! Now do want that game?,Agh! Why? You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.
If you buy that cologne then I'm gonna lose all respect for you.,"No, I still want the cologne."
"Ugh! What's with you? We had a plan: coffee, Strong Johns, hang out!",Good. Then we'll both have the same amount of respect for each other.
"No, that wasn't part of the plan! If you leave, then I'm gonna have to get some new friends!","Dude, we can hang out later. I just wanna go buy some that cologne really quick."
Well fine. I'll be busy with my new friends! Plan-breaker!,That's cool. I'll probably be too busy with the ladies anyway.
Are you done with your stupid cologne yet? You know that stuff's not gonna work.,Well fine. I'll be busy with my new friends! Plan-breaker!
(laughs) In your face! I knew that stuff wasn't gonna work.,"Mordecai, Rigby, wonderful day we're hav--. (He smells something funky, which is the cologne, and he runs away squealing in horror.)"
"I dunno. They seem pretty cool, though!",Who are these guys?
(gasps) I wanna hang out! But you're wasting your time with this guy. All he wants to do is get with Margaret.,You bros wanna hang out?
"Yeah, hee hee! Finally somebody's speaking my language! (Rigby joins in with the chant of Bros.)",Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros!
"Yeah, fun! Ever hear of it?","Chill out, bro. We're just having a little fun."
Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meeeeeh.!,Great. As long as I don't have to stand next to that total loser I'm up for anything.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!,(screaming) Wait what?!
"Dude, they're just partying.","Dude, these guys aren't trying to help me. They're just messing with me."
They got you a lady!,How is this supposed to help me get the ladies?
"Hey, bros, check this out. (Approaches Mordecai) Here, let me help you up. (He pulls his hand away at the last second.) Psych! Why don't you ask Margaret to help you up? Ohhhhh!",(angrily) Something's touching me!
"(worried) Mordecai, wait!","You know what, Rigby? Have fun with your new friends, you jerk. Oh, and just so you know, when Benson finds out about your friends and their little hangout time, he's probably gonna fire ya. Later, bro."
No! (Rigby runs up to his room) What are you doing to my bed?,(from upstairs) Bros! I found a trampoline!
Get off it!,"You sleep on this, bro?!"
My bed!,"Right after this somersault. (The unicorn flips in mid air and his horn rips the trampoline, falling to the floor.) Bros, this trampoline's all over me. Help me get it off!"
"Hey, Mordecai.","(slaps Rigby) Yeah, dude. Chill out. (Elbows Rigby) And have a drink! (He sprays Rigby with a soda can, temporarily blinding Rigby. In his confusion, Rigby stumbles between the unicorns, who have formed a circle with the intention of repeatedly farting on him)"
"Heh, huh... So, I sorta need your help.",Don't touch me!
"Dude, get over it! It's not my fault! If you would have just hung out with me and played some Strong Johns, none of this woulda happened.",Why don't you ask your new bros for help?
"(avoiding eye contact, speaking quickly and quietly) I'm sorry.","Look, I'm sorry about the game, but that doesn't give you the right to treat me like garbage! (yells) You owe me an apology!"
"OK, I'm sorry. I'm... sorry! (screaming) Is that what you want to hear? (screaming louder) I MISS YOU!!!! I miss you...! (Rigby looks like he's about to cry)",A real apology.
Ahh! Why?!,"OK, quit being a baby. (He punches Rigby in the arm)"
"Dude, you have to help me.",It's gonna suck for you when Benson gets untied.
We have a problem.,Hey Skips.
How'd you know?,Unicorns?
Yeah.,"You guys know what to do, right?"
But what if they come back?,This is how you get rid of unicorns.
(sparkles in their eyes) Cool!,They ain't comin' back!
The unicorn one? (Benson sprays Rigby with the hose and Rigby screams) Coooooollld!,"I can't believe you idiots let those unicorns in here! You two morons (In the UK, Morons is changed to Idiots.) had better get this mess cleaned up, or you'll wish it was YOU DRIVING THAT CAR!!!"
Strong Johns?,Wanna go... bro?
"Dude, these are probably the best graphics I've ever seen in my life.",D-d-d-d-d-da-Dig Champs!
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't play game like this right out of the box. We should stretch it out first.","Oh man. Dude, let's play it."
"We don't want to pull our hammies, know what I'm saying?","Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't play game like this right out of the box. We should stretch it out first."
"Hey, what are you doing?","We don't want to pull our hammies, know what I'm saying?"
"Aw, what? I wanted to be Player One!",Starting. Hurry up and pick your character. (laughs)
I don't wanna be Player Two! He just digs with the sucky pickaxe! I want the one with the shovel!,"Dude, I'm Player One. You're Player Two."
Then why don't you be Player Two?,"Dude, they're exactly the same!"
(gasps) See!?,"Pfft, I'm not using that sucky pickaxe."
Fine.,"Dude, calm down. Let's play punchies to see who gets to be Player One."
No!,Looks like I'm Player One.
"It's not fair, you always get your way!",No!
"""Let's play punchies! Let's play punchies!"" I'm sick of it! Of course I'm not gonna beat you at punchies!","It's not fair, you always get your way!"
"Yes, I do!","Dude, you don't beat anybody at punchies."
Stop talking!! There was only damage to the one cheek and you know it!,"Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, wee-ooh! ""Quick, doctor! Both of these buttcheeks are unrecognizable! If we want anybody to be able to recognize this as a butt in the future, then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!"""
You better not!,"(laughs) That's right! We used to call you the One Cheek Wonder! Dude, I'm bringing it back."
Shut up! Don't look at them!,Is that One Cheek Wonder? I hope he's not trying to play punchies with cheeks like that!
"I'll win at punchies, you'll see!",Shut up! Don't look at them!
Dumb Mordecai! I hate you!,"I'll win at punchies, you'll see!"
You're ruining my life!,You better not be messing up my side of the room!
Stupid bo - book?,You're ruining my life!
"Death Kwon Do? ""Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments! Unlock your full potential today?""",Stupid bo - book?
Yes!,"Death Kwon Do? ""Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments! Unlock your full potential today?"""
Why not?,"It's a touching story. Really, it is. But I don't know if you're ready for Death Kwon Do."
"Uh, no? Can you just teach me something?","Death Kwon Do is all about self-defense. But from the sound of it, you just want to hit harder."
That one. That's the one I want: The Death Punch.,"Let's see, we could start you off with the Bicep Flex of Death. Or there's the Leg Lifts of Death, that's a good beginner's move. Or the Pelvic Thrust of Death, that's one of my personal favorites."
"What, why!?","That, I'm afraid, is not for beginners."
What!? Don't call me not pure of heart! What about you with your crappy mullet? You're the one who's not pure of heart!,Because you only wanna use it to beat up your friends. You're not pure of heart!
Whoa...time to take this baby for a test drive.,Nooooooooo!!
"You're next, Mordecai!","Oh no, bro..."
"Where are you, Mordecai!? I wanna play you punchies!",Death Kwon Do?
"Hey, mister! Have you seen Mordecai?","Where are you, Mordecai!? I wanna play you punchies!"
Have you seen him?,"Hey, mister! Have you seen Mordecai?"
How about you?,Have you seen him?
Now massage this foot!,"Oh, so you think you're gonna beat me at punchies? Well, I got news for you. I know your little secret."
"Then rub it again! Unless you wanna get punched again? And Pops, what's with the easy-breezy? Speed it up, my pepperonis are roasting down here!",But I already did that one.
"Muscle Man, do you see Mordecai yet?","Then rub it again! Unless you wanna get punched again? And Pops, what's with the easy-breezy? Speed it up, my pepperonis are roasting down here!"
Gimme those!,"I'm right here, Rigby."
Looks like you learned the ways of Death Kwon Do.,Gimme those!
Whatever. You can't handle the Death Punch.,Looks like you know how to say things that people are already aware of.
That's because maybe it is a challenge.,That sounds like a challenge.
Muscle Man! Hi Fives! Carry me down.,"Well then, what are you doing up there?"
"Don't drop me. Be careful. Whoa, whoa! Leaning, leaning!",Muscle Man! Hi Fives! Carry me down.
Here! Here! Set me here.,"Don't drop me. Be careful. Whoa, whoa! Leaning, leaning!"
What move did you learn?,Here! Here! Set me here.
What?,Why don't you come over here and find out?
How come you're not dead yet?,What?
I'll kill you!!,It worked pretty good for a first try. Either that or your Death Punch totally blows.
Not until I smash you!,Are you finished yet?
What? Are you afraid of a little lava?,Whoa.
Never! Not until I beat you at punchies!,"Dude, this is serious! We gotta get out of here!"
I don't care! I'm sick of you always winning!,"Dude, stop! We're gonna die!"
I'm not quitting 'till I win!,I don't care! I'm sick of you always winning!
"Ha! I told you I was gonna win! In your face! Yay, I finally get to be Player One!","Ahh! You got me! You got me! Ahh, you got me. You win. We have to stop now 'cause I lost."
That's all I ever wanted!,What!? That's what this is about? You just wanted to be Player One?
"I know, but what good is being Player One now? We're just gonna die in this lava!","Dude, quit crying. I said you could be Player One."
Really? How!?,"Don't worry, dude. I can get us away from the lava."
Wha'?,You think I'm dumb enough to only steal one Death Kwon Do move?
"Aw, sick! Better go with the Death Jump.","Now, how do you wanna get out of here? The Death Jump or the Death Dump?"
"Aw, yes! It's finally happening!",D-d-d-d-d-da-Dig Champs!
Stop talking!,"Yep. For once, being a huge baby actually worked out for you."
"""Mememememememememememe!"" (grunts) I'll show you.","Heheheh. Dude, just hurry up and play. You're just gonna die right at the beginning anyway."
"Aw, what? Snails are bad? I thought snails were good!","""Mememememememememememe!"" (grunts) I'll show you."
"Aw, man. This sucks. I wanna be Player Two.","No, dude. Snails are bad."
"(Laughing) Dude! I'm open, I'm open, dude!","Aw, man. This sucks. I wanna be Player Two."
"Touchdown, sock faces!","(Snickers) Go long, dude!"
Boo!,"Aw, what?"
(Blows his lips) What's the big deal? It's not like an audit is a bad thing.,(Sad) Oh.
We do?,(Thinks) Hmmm... Hmph. Hey! (looks at Rigby) We know someone.
No! No way!,We do?
Shut up!,Rigby has a brother. (Rigby punches Mordecai.) And he's an accountant. (Rigby punches Mordecai rapidly.)
No!,Call your brother!
No! I hate him!,Call your brother!
You better not!,"Fine. (To Mordecai) Mordecai, you call him."
"Dude, he could ruin my life! If he comes, I'm gonna tell him to leave!","Dude, he could save the park!"
Grrrr!,"(Pats Rigby) Dude, just be cool until he stops the audit."
You guys are making a big mistake.,Grrrr!
Don't you have taxis to do? Why don't you get to it?,"Rigby. Give me some sugar, bro."
Augh! I can't wait for you to get out of my life!,(Chuckles) Oh. He was always greedy with the sugar.
(flinching) Nothing.,(Angrily whispers to Rigby) You keep your mouth shut!
"(Mocking Don) ""Ohh, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love.""",I'm just lucky I get to do what I love.
Shouldn't you be fixing the augite?,(Turns around) Rigbone. Sugar?
Don't correct me! I know what it is!,You mean the audit?
"Hello, ""Mordo"". Enjoying your game?",I got it!
He's not even doing the debit!,(Grunts) Rigby!
You don't get it! He...,"It's audit! (Sighs) Rigby, why don't you just try being nice to your brother? He's actually pretty cool."
NO!,"Ah, I just about got this. With a few minutes to spare. (Rigby walks in.) Rigbone. How about a little pre-saving the park sugar? You know? for almost being done saving the park?"
Yeah. You were born!,What's going on with us? You never give me some sugar. Did I do something?
"Ah, he's not so cool.","Dude, what are you doing? He was almost done!"
OK. (He presses another button and more ads pop up. The screen turns red and vibrates dangerously.) Augh! Mordecai! Help!,"Ah, he's not so cool."
I don't know!,What did you do?
"No, no, no!",This doesn't make any sense.
"(Imitates Don, badly) Uh, almost done, Benson-bone. (Normal voice, to Mordecai) How do I send this thing?",Don? We brought you a cake. It's almost three. Were you able to stop the audit?
No! I hate him!,"No dude, call your brother back."
Augh! Must... push... send!,Don't... Don't send it! Don't!
Crap!,Augh! Must... push... send!
(Even more furious) NEVER!,(Furious) What?! Go give him some sugar!
(In a sad voice) Rigby's not here right now.,Rigby? Rigby! (He looks for Rigby and eventually sees his tail poking out from under a pile of clothes on his trampoline.) Rigby!
"Don't tell me what to do! You don't know what it's like to have a brother, so you don't know!",Quit being so selfish! (Moves clothing out of the way) The park is disappearing! We have to end this.
(Climbing out from under a t-shirt) Really?,"You're right. I don't have a brother. But I kinda know what it's like... 'cause I have you, dude. You're like my brother."
"Don, please! I need your help with the audit, bro.","Look, I'm glad you guys stopped by but... I just can't finish the audit. I'm sorry."
No! It wasn't just the birthday party. It's everything.,He's mad about the birthday party.
Huh?,"I... I had no idea. I'm sorry, bro. I didn't mean to steal your friends. I was just trying to be cool like you."
I tried to do the taxis!,"Jeez! What did you do, bro?"
Do it!,"Alright, I got it! I just have to do one more thing."
Why isn't anything happening?,Do it!
WHAT?,"Because... (Stands up and turns around, arms outstretched) I still need some sugar, bro."
Shut up!,(Leaning in to Rigby with a giant smirk on his face) Sugar?
"Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man! Mordecai, check it out! I found it in the trash in the back. Isn't it cool?",Shut up!
"You're unnatural! Besides, this is different. It's a treasure from the past.","Dude, you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash. It's unnatural."
We should put some food on this baby!,It is a pretty sweet plate.
"Ahhhhh, yes. But how can we afford something as good as chocolate cake?","Hmm, hmm. Agreed. You know what would look great on this plate? Chocolate cake!"
"I can't wait to eat that greasy pig. Wait, how much does it cost?","Don't worry, dude. I think I know where we can get one."
Aaaargh!,(Looks at the box) A buck fifty.
I told you cake mix is too expensive.,Aaaargh!
Ooh! I got it! There's that chocolate cake at the snack bar!,"(Sighs) Well, I'm all out of ideas."
Who's to say it's not my birthday?,"Yeah. But, Benson will only let you have it for free if it's your birthday."
Free cake! Free cake!,Who's to say it's not my birthday?
"Aw, man! He's killing us with that!",It's neither of your birthdays.
(Sadly) No cake. No cake.,"Aw, man! He's killing us with that!"
Free cake! Free cake!,But it is Skips' birthday.
(Sadly) No cake. No cake.,But he's really private about it.
(Who interrupts) And cake.,"Dude, that sucks. Skips totally deserves a party."
And also a cake.,"Whenever something goes wrong, it's Skips who fixes it. Heâ€™s always there for us, no matter what. I bet Skips wants a party, but he's such a quiet guy he doesn't know how to ask. We owe him a party."
"Oh, I know! Let's get a van.","Oh, we know how to get him on board."
BAM! Free cake!,"Happy birthday, Skips."
"But we can't just tell him. You heard Benson, Skips isn't into this stuff.","No, dude. Thatâ€™s kidnapping."
"Argh, laaaame!","I know, but dude, Skips is cool. We should just go and tell him we gonna throw him a party."
"Two things: one, no surprise, and two, no vans.",What? What's wrong with that?
"What, vans?",(gasp) That's it.
"Dude, that's perfect!","No, Surprise. Dude, we should throw Skips a surprise party!"
'Cause they can't.,"Yeah, I know. 'Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party."
"Dude, Check it. We'll just lie to Benson and get the cake first, and figure out the Skips part later.","Argh, man. What would we do now?"
"Yeah, he wants an extra-large chocolate one.",We told him there's gonna be cake.
"But he wants it to be a surprise, so if you see him, don't say anything. (Mordecai punches Rigby.) Ow!",Yeah. 8:00. His place.
Let's eat it!,We did it!
"Arghhhhhhh, fine. We'll do dish duty.",No! You heard Benson. Do you wanna be on dish duty?
Are you sure Skips is even here?,"No, dude. We have to get Skips."
It's a medical emergency.,Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods. Where else should we look? (Rigby's stomach rumbles.) Don't touch that cake.
Are you a doctor now? Did you go to medical school in the past 5 minutes?,You just ate a sandwich.
"Ohhhh, man, it's almost 8. We're not gonna find him, let's just eat it.",Ohhhh... Don't turn on the lights.
Benson's gonna get like that no matter what. (Grabs the cake from Mordecai.) Better to have no regrets.,"No. Benson's gonna get pissed, so we shouldnâ€™t. (In reruns, the line is changed to ""Benson's gonna get ticked, so we shouldn't."")"
"That's funny. Usually, if there's a strange noise in the woods, you don't check it out. Mordecai? (They see Skips singing and jumping around a blue-colored bonfire with a big rattle.) What's Skips doing?","Dude! No! (Grabs the cake back. Rigby jumps on Mordecai trying to get the cake.) RIGBY! GET OFF! (Mordecai throws Rigby off and tries to run away with the cake, but Rigby gets him. They fight over the cake.) Dude! Quit it! You're ruining the cake! (A mysterious sound is heard.) Wait. What's that? Sounds like some kind of weird Aztec ritual... (Mordecai and Rigby stop fighting. While Mordecai was puzzling over the sound Rigby sneakily obtained the cake.) I think it's coming from over there. We should go to check it out."
What about the cake?,I don't know. But it looks kind of important. Maybe we should leave him alone.
"You're coming with us, Skips!",Would you forget about the cake for a minute? Rigby!
"And ourselves! No Skips, no cake!","Dude, I think we just screwed Skips!"
Dude. What's with the babies? We've got to get Skips back to the park.,Come on. We better follow him. (They jump into the trunk. The pickup arrives onto a sandy island in the space.) Dude. What the...
"Yeah, man. Let him finish that dance thing!",But this is our fault! We interrupted the dance before he could finish!
SKIPS!!!!!,The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned.
"Yeah, we're sorry.","We're sorry, Skips."
Yeah. It was going to be really cool. We were gonna eat cake...,(sniffles) We just wanna to throw you a surprise party.
No. Thereâ€™s no cake.,Cake? Did someone say cake?
No way!,"Give me the cake, dude."
"Mordecai, what are you doing?","Nah, The cake for Skips."
Alright.,Dude. Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?
"Aw, what? They are not even eating it! They're just smushing it on their faces!",Done!
"Hey, Skips. We've got you a birthday present. (Rigby gives Skips the plate he found in a trash.) It says: SKIPS --- GODFATHER OF SOUL.",You guys almost killed me for some cake?
I don't remember anything about cake.,"Ahh, cake?"
Must be a misunderstanding.,Me neither.
You wanted that cake for this party?,"Oh, The cake from the snack bar."
The important thing is we are all together.,"Ha-ha-ha! Oh, man! I mean what a mix-up, right?"
"Mordecai! Mordecai! Oh, there you are. You want half of this grilled cheese?","Ha-ha! Yes! Finally! (Takes a piece of the cake.) Argh, Vanilla...?"
"Yes, it is.",Whoa! Is that a Grilled Cheese Deluxe from Cheezer's?
I bought it. With money.,How did you manage this?
"No, wait! I know a really good one. (Types on the keyboard)","Nice! Hey, you know what would go good with these sandwiches? Funny internet videos! Dude, check this out. (Begins typing in name on the keyboard)"
"No, Iâ€™m not.","No, man! Youâ€™re just gonna pull up that ostrich thing with the balls again."
"Dude, donâ€™t look! Youâ€™re gonna ruin it!",Youâ€™re typing it in! I see it!
Itâ€™s loading. Okay... Now!,Fine. It better not be that ostrich thing with the balls. Ready yet?
â€˜Cause lyingâ€™s my specialty.,"Man, itâ€™s that ostrich thing with the balls! Why do you gotta lie to me, dude?"
Donâ€™t worry. Iâ€™ll take care of this with my specialty. This isnâ€™t your sandwich. This is our sandwich.,What?
"Huh? itâ€™s supposed to say ""Rigby,"" but they misspelled my name wrong.","This is your sandwich, huh? Then how come it says ""Benson"" on the bag?"
"Ah, donâ€™t worry, dude. The line wonâ€™t be that long.",Argh! You ruined our day off!
Whatever. Like you could do any better.,"Thanks for saving the day with your specialty, you idiot."
"Oh, really? The only thing youâ€™re better than me at is being a big piece of-",Pfff. Iâ€™m a better liar than you are.
"(Rises off the ground and gasps) Dude, hereâ€™s your chance to prove youâ€™re a better liar than me. Or maybe you canâ€™t? Look at your face. (Touches Mordecai's face all around) It must really eat you up inside to not be able to prove youâ€™re a better liar than me. â€˜Cause you can prove nothing. You, Canâ€™t, Prove, Anything!",Excuse me! Those fine men are astronauts! They can cut in line. They fought for our country! Huh!
Okay. Itâ€™s not like youâ€™re ever gonna lie better than thi-i-is...,(Slaps away Rigby's hand and picks him up) Fine! You want me to prove Iâ€™m a better liar than you? Why wouldnâ€™t we see who is better in lying? Whoever gets caught first loses.
"Woah, woah, woah! Step aside. Iâ€™ll show you how a real man lies. (Approaches a counter) Hey, baby. Give me a Grilled Cheese Deluxe and make it snappy, â€˜cause weâ€™re astronauts and we gotta get back up in space. Know what Iâ€™m sayinâ€™?","We're astronauts. (They enter the Cheezerâ€™s, cutting in line.) Bam! I told you Iâ€™m a better liar than you!"
Bam! Thatâ€™s a moon quarter. (Points to a quarter),"Oh, my. (Speaks using a loudspeaker) One Grilled Cheese Deluxe for the astronauts. (The announcement arouses the real astronautsâ€™ curiosity.) Thatâ€™ll be two fifty."
"Hmm, hmm. See?",Oh! (Takes the money)
This is the guy.,Huh? (Sees Rigby talking with Barry & Jones) ARGHHHH!!! (Comes up to them)
"Hmm, hmm!",Iâ€™m...
"Ah, you know. We're just pickin' up a Grilled Cheese for our commanding officer.","So, what are you guys doing in this dump hole, anyways?"
"Weâ€™ve just got back from a 10-year stand in the old shuttlecraft. Isnâ€™t that right, Captain Mordecai?","Come to think of it, why havenâ€™t we seen you around the compound before...?"
"Oh, uh, I forgot my ID in my other pants. Can you help me out, guys?","Gentlemen, welcome to the compound! ('Compound' echos)"
"Ah, thanks. Yeah, I love these things, but Captain Mordecai might not be that into 'em. Donâ€™t you like the uniforms in pink?","Guys, guys, calm down. You can use our IDs. (They pass the checkpoint.) Here. You, guys, might be more comfortable in these. (Passes them jackets)"
"Hmm, hmm. Weâ€™ll see.","Dude, you should quit right now. Youâ€™re totally gonna get caught."
"Man, I donâ€™t think you can last much longer. I think you should give it up.","Hmm, hmm. Weâ€™ll see."
Then I guess itâ€™s time that I start lying at one hundred percent. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?!,They're not onto me.
"Oh, thatâ€™s too bad. Captain hereâ€™s an expert on it.","(Slaps Jimmy again, causing Jimmy to drop his clipboard right onto a green button, pushing it) Thatâ€™s fate. I donâ€™t understand a half of that these science types say."
(Frustrated) Uh...,Uh... Yeah... Uh... But not compared to how much this guy knows. (Points to Rigby)
We wrote a book on it.,Did you know he wrote a book on it?
But your nameâ€™s on the cover.,"Well, you did the most of the work on it."
Above mine!,"Yeah, right next yours."
"Sure, we can. Go ahead, Captain.","Trouble? We-ell, these guys are experts! Can you lend a hand, fellas?"
(Cuts in) But captainâ€™s own research really out-dates mine. So turn that knob over there.,"(Approaches the control panel) Well, according to the book lieutenant Rigby wrote, you wanna turn that knob there."
Discoveries based on his studies... Hit those buttons.,But heâ€™s forgetting the recent discoveries he made. Flip those switches.
"Yeah, Jimmy, youâ€™re not doing like Captain Mordecai said! You gotta do it like this! (Bumps over all the buttons)",I never said hit those buttons!
"No, youâ€™re gonna break it!","Dude, quit! Youâ€™re gonna break it!"
Not without captainâ€™s help!,Yes. Lieutenant Riggs can totally fix it.
What? Youâ€™re the one who wonâ€™t admit that you suck at lying.,"Dude, this is all your fault."
Why don't you give up and tell â€˜em whatâ€™s going on so they can help us?,â€˜Cause I donâ€™t!
No way!,"No, you do it."
Hey!,Look. I have to tell you the truth. (Rigby nods.) I have a condition that makes me forget everything in times of extreme stress. (Rigby's mouth hangs open in shock.) Lieutenant Riggs doesnâ€™t have that condition. Heâ€™s just an idiot.
WHAT?!?!,Right! Listen up! You have one chance at this thing. You have to throw Lieutenant Riggs into the anti-nucleus.
"NO!! Donâ€™t listen to him, Mordecai! DONâ€™T DO IT!!!!","Itâ€™s the only way. Captain Mordecai is too big for you to throw. You must sacrifice yourself to save thousands of lives, lieutenant!"
Please! No! No!,Do it! Throw him in! THROW HIM IN!!!
"Iâ€™m sorry! Iâ€™m sorry for lying! You win, okay? I wonâ€™t lie anymore!",Throw him now! NOW!!!
NO!!!!,"Itâ€™s too late, Rigby. I canâ€™t let everybody die because of us. (Mordecai lifts Rigby up over his head and is about to throw him in...)"
Huh? (Sees that his jacket is unzipped),NO!!!!
Bensonâ€™s grilled cheese!,You thought I was gonna throw you in? I told you Iâ€™m a better liar than you. (Holds the grilled cheese bag in his hand)
Nyahh!,You better hope this works. Huh!
Weâ€™re not astronauts.,Rigby! Ahh!
"We saved the city, astro-","If you ever lie about being astronauts again, YOUâ€™RE DEAD!!!"
There were spacemen! At Cheezerâ€™s! And the tube... we went down and... everyone wore sweatpants... even us... and then the room with the bad stuff... but... we saved the city with your sandwich.,What the...? What happened to my sandwich?
Agh!,"Let's see, I'm picking up the kids, so...Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs."
Lame!,"Dude, how come we always get stuck with the lame jobs? Setting up the chairs!?"
Did he? Did you?,You calling us slackers?
"Yeah, and then next time you'll get someone else to set up the chairs?",We will.
OOHHH! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Uh!,Fine.
"Benson's gonna drop his balls when he sees how good we set up these chairs! He's gonna be all like ""Oh no, my gumballs!""",Just set up the chairs.
One!,"(laughs) Yeah-yuh, we rule at setting up the chairs! (hands Rigby a chair) One."
"Yeah, dude. This sucks.",One!
Alright. Gah! Must be nice to be the boss. Benson never has to do chores.,"I agree dude, and normally I'd be all ""let's quit"", but we have to prove to Benson we can set up these chairs."
(laughs hysterically),"What the H, dude?"
"Ugh, when you say that, it makes me tired.",Can we please just focus?
"Ugh, you sound like Benson.",Dude.
"Next time, it could be us picking up -","Dude! Listen, if we pound through this, we'll never have to do this lame chair stuff again."
The special entertainment!,"Next time, it could be us picking up -"
"That's all the chairs, dude.",Rigby!
That's Benson's problem.,There's supposed to be fifty.
Hmm!,"No, dude. That's our problem."
Fine. Let's find your stupid chairs.,"Come on, we gotta find the rest."
"It won't open, let's get out of here.",Fine. Let's find your stupid chairs.
"Agh, you're killing me!",Did you try the actual doorknob?
"It's locked, let's do something else.","Agh, you're killing me!"
"Hmph, hmph.","Oh, it is locked."
Hey!,We gotta get those chairs.
Whoa!,Hey!
Even better...,"Ugh, you see the chairs?"
It's like old school heaven!,What do you me- (gasps)
Who cares? Let's play!,"Ball of Yarn, Lemonade Stand, Hats 4 Sale, Clap Like This, Candle Maker, Deli Dude, Staring Contest!? Why are these even here!?"
I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?,"No, dude! Dude, no. You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?"
"Whatever, I'm taking my break.","Not cool, dude."
"Whatever, why don't you go back to work?","Dude, you're not even doing it right. You're just mashing the buttons."
"Man, that was just luck.",OOHHH!!
"Wait, man. What about that one?","OOHHH! Ten in a row! Alright, let's finish those chairs."
Whoa! This...looks...awesome!,"Didn't they teach you how to read? ""Out of order""."
"Probably 'cause people couldn't stop playing it, 'cause it's so awesome!","Yeah. Whatever, it's broken."
Hey! Why don't you go ask Benson to tell you what to do?,"Pfft, how are you gonna fix that with your third grade education?"
"""In the name of all that is holy, don't connect the red wire to the blue wire""?","Move over, Rigby."
"Come on, come on!",I don't think we should do this.
I don't know!,"Dude, what just happened?"
"I don't know, he could be cool.",That can't be good.
Maybe no one will notice.,"Oh man, we're so dead."
You mean like a musical note?,A note? What note?
Get outta here!,"Wait, what? Distract it how?"
Uh oh.,Get outta here!
"Aw, what!? Legs? Legs suck! Man, this is worse than the chairs!","Mordecai and I got the arms, Rigby, you got the legs."
Shut up!,"Dude! Quit mashing the buttons, you're messing up the legs!"
"It's too dangerous, just leave them!","Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds! I'm gonna go get the chairs!"
(gasps) Mordecai!,I don't care! We're not slackers!
I told you I got skills!,That was some pretty sweet button mashing.
"So we're cool, right?",Woo! This birthday party's hot!
OOHHH! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time!,"You idiots! That's the last time I entrust you with something important, like the chairs!"
We got it.,"Yeah, no problem."
"We're gonna take a break first, right?",Don't worry about us.
"Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!",Yeah.
Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.,What's here?
"Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said...",What?
"""Face Punch.""","Yes, I wanna be in a band with you. Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name. What do you think of ""Cool Dudes""?"
"""Helicopter Crash.""","""Rad 'N' Subtract."""
That's it! That's it!,"What about ""Mustache Cash Stash""?"
"Check it out. Bam! (Pulls out a ""Mordecai and the Rigbys"" t-shirt)","Oh yeah, T-Shirts."
"I changed it. Awesome, right? (Throws a t-shirt at Mordecai)",Mordecai and the Rigbys? What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?
They're for our band.,"Woah, rad shirts! What are those for?"
"What was that, man?",Yeah... see you then... then. (Faceplants on the table)
But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!,I don't know! I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!
One song?,"OK, OK, we can totally do this. We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night."
Shreddy.,Ready?
"Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously.",Augh!
Put on the shirt.,What?
"Yeah, and there's still two more after this one! (Holds up the remaining two records)","(Talks over the record) Augh, this is gonna take like ten years!"
All three at once?,... all washed up? Good! Now just locate your...
"Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything!","(from three speakers)... one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped..."
I don't know!,"Dude, what's happening?!"
"Wait, wait. We suck, and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?","Dude, this is perfect!"
"Awesome! Oh, hey, in the future, do we get that thing we always wanted?","Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades."
Awesome!,"Oh, we got it. (Pulls up shirt to reveal a biting shark tattoo on his armpit, which bites when he moves his arm)"
We haven't even picked up a guitar.,But we never learned how to play!
Dang!,"(sings) ... my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you. (song ends to wild applause. Mordecai and Rigby watch from behind a curtain)"
Should I hand out the last of the t-shirts?,"Yeah. (Mordecai walks backstage, holding his stomach and groaning. Rigby picks up a box)"
"Yeah, for the fans.",You brought the t-shirts?
"(still playing the unplugged electric guitar, badly) Uhuh! Yeah! Yeah, baby!","No! Augh! (Mordecai sees a CD player at the side of the stage. Future Mordecai and Rigby wave and play air-guitar. Mordecai rushes over and turns off the CD, and the crowd falls silent but for a few calls of ""What?"")"
Me neither!,"(angry) No, that's lame! You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be."
I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing. This is awesome!,Yeah-heah! Alright!
(pause) Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.,"Oh, yeah. See you, guys! Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice."
"The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet, right, Mordecai?","I'm a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama! (Mordecai & Rigby both laugh at the prank call video) Oh, yeah! You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!"
"Hmm, hmm, hmm!","Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny. But you know what's even funnier than watching prank phone calls?"
"[On the phone, off-screen] Hello, Pops?",Hello?
"[On the phone, off-screen] Please hold for a collect call from... JOE MAMA!!!",Yes?
"Hey, Skips, do you have a son named ""Joe Mama""?",Hello?
HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE?!?!?!,"Oh, dude, he's still on the phone!"
"O-O-O-h! Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?","HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE! H, HA, HA, HA!!!"
What? Uh. Did you not hear what we just did? We were hilarious!,"Yeah, second best."
Who are you calling? (Mordecai stops shifting through pages and points to a number on the book),"Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this."
Holy crap.,The Master Prank Caller.
"Aw, '80s cellphones!","Aw, cool! What kind are they? (Rigby pulls a case from under Pops' bed and opens it to find 80s brick-sized phones.)"
"Cool. Thanks, Pops.","Aw, '80s cellphones!"
Alright. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.,"Oh, and boys... do be careful. I think they might cause brain tumors. (Dramatic music plays as Pops turns back to the phone and then his head starts to throb. Mordecai and Rigby exchange knowing glances.)"
Let me take a crack at it. (Rigby dials and the telephone rings again),"Yeah, uh, okay. I gotta go. (Mordecai hangs up the phone)"
"(Idiotic voice) Hi, this is Stan.",Hello?
Uh... Stan... (Normal voice) Stanminson.,Stan who?
Uh... yep.,Your name is Stan Stanminson?
I don't know.,"Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard. And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?"
"What, you givin' up? Dude, we can prank this guy. Do you want to be this guy's son, or do you want to be number one?","Whoa, this guy's good. I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this."
Hmm.,[off-screen] Did it. (MPC hangs up)
"Yeah, buddy, it's Joe Ma...!",Hmm.
"""Yeah, hello?"" Dude, that was the worst try yet.",[off-screen] You got anything original? (MPC hangs up)
Time to put an end to this junk fest. Hmm.,"""Yeah, hello?"" Dude, that was the worst try yet."
"Yeah, right, like your ""50 pizzas"" thing was way better.",Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.
"Uh... not me, dude.","Pff, nice try, dude. I know it's you."
Where are we?,AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are we?,"Dude, I think we're back at the park."
"(eyeing the spots) Dude, all the trees are small, and look at that park bench, it's so new looking. I'm telling you, something weird's going on.",What do you mean?
"I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on.",What?
"Hey, guys!","I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on."
You notice anything strange going on around here?,"Hey, guys!"
"Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries? We're in the '80s, dude! Pops, what year is this?",You notice anything strange going on around here?
See?,"Well, it's 1982, of course."
"I know, I don't even like the '80s that much!","Dude, this is bad."
Let's do it.,The only way we're gonna get back is that we prank him harder than he pranked us.
Hang up! Hang up!,"[off-screen] What did I tell you about calling me?! (A yellow, sparkling cloud begins to shoot out of the top of the phone, shocking Mordecai and Rigby)"
The cart!,We should get out of here.
Hello?,The cart!
"Listen, just leave us alone, will you?!","Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the '80s!"
Who?!,"Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!"
"Pops, you gotta help us; we're stuck in the '80s!","Ooh, telephone. Hello?"
What? Give me that!,Crap! He thinks we're pranking him!
"The '80s [off-screen] called, they want their cell phones back!",What? Give me that!
"Dude, we just hit past Pops!","Mordecai, look out!"
"It will, Mordecai. It has to.","Man, I hope this works."
"Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?! (Rigby climbs up the phone and hits the power button)","Now, Rigby, hit the power button!"
