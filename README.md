Discord Conversational Chatbot is running on meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct sourced from Hugging Face.

Chatbot accesses Discord using a specified token id loaded from a .env file. 

When a user sends a message through Discord, the chatbot will send a reply message to the same channel. To send a message to the bot, send a message through Discord beginning with !c.

Example input:

!c Hi, How are you.
